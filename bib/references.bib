                  impact marine organisms that precipitate calcium carbonate
                  skeletons. Past geological events, such as the
                  Permian-Triassic Mass Extinction, together with modern
                  experiments generally support these concerns. However, the
                  physiological costs of producing a calcium carbonate skeleton
                  under different acidification scenarios remain poorly
                  understood. Here we present an idealized mathematical model to
                  quantify whole-skeleton costs, concluding that they rise only
                  modestly (up to ∼10\%) under acidification expected for 2100.
                  The modest magnitude of this effect reflects in part the low
                  energetic cost of inorganic, calcium carbonate relative to the
                  proteinaceous organic matrix component of skeletons. Our
                  analysis does, however, point to an important kinetic
                  constraint that depends on seawater carbonate chemistry, and
                  we hypothesize that the impact of acidification is more likely
                  to cause extinctions within groups where the timescale of
                  larval development is tightly constrained. The cheapness of
                  carbonate skeletons compared to organic materials also helps
                  explain the widespread evolutionary convergence upon
                  calcification within the metazoa.},

                  physiology of differential climate change effects on organisms
                  is one of the many urgent challenges faced in ecology and
                  evolutionary biology. We explore how physiological ecology can
                  contribute to a holistic view of climate change impacts on
                  organisms and ecosystems and their evolutionary responses. We
                  suggest that theoretical and experimental efforts not only
                  need to improve our understanding of thermal limits to
                  organisms, but also to consider multiple stressors both on
                  land and in the oceans. As an example, we discuss recent
                  efforts to understand the effects of various global change
                  drivers on aquatic ectotherms in the field that led to the
                  development of the concept of oxygen and capacity limited
                  thermal tolerance (OCLTT) as a framework integrating various
                  drivers and linking organisational levels from ecosystem to
                  organism, tissue, cell, and molecules. We suggest seven core
                  objectives of a comprehensive research program comprising the
                  interplay among physiological, ecological, and evolutionary
                  approaches for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. While
                  studies of individual aspects are already underway in many
                  laboratories worldwide, integration of these findings into
                  conceptual frameworks is needed not only within one organism
                  group such as animals but also across organism domains such as
                  Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Indeed, development of
                  unifying concepts is relevant for interpreting existing and
                  future findings in a coherent way and for projecting the
                  future ecological and evolutionary effects of climate change
                  on functional biodiversity. We also suggest that OCLTT may in
                  the end and from an evolutionary point of view, be able to
                  explain the limited thermal tolerance of metazoans when

                  yet most studies focus on organismal-level impacts rather than
                  ecological perturbations. Field studies are especially sparse,
                  particularly ones examining shifts in direct and indirect
                  consumer interactions. Here we address such connections within
                  tidepool communities of rocky shores, focusing on a
                  three-level food web involving the keystone sea star predator,
                  Pisaster ochraceus, a common herbivorous snail, Tegula
                  funebralis, and a macroalgal basal resource, Macrocystis
                  pyrifera. We demonstrate that during nighttime low tides,
                  experimentally manipulated declines in seawater pH suppress
                  the anti-predator behavior of snails, bolstering their
                  grazing, and diminishing the top-down influence of predators
                  on basal resources. This attenuation of top-down control is
                  absent in pools maintained experimentally at higher pH. These
                  findings suggest that as ocean acidification proceeds, shifts

                  provided an unprecedented opportunity to test the effect of
                  predators on rocky intertidal prey. Mass mortalities provide
                  insight that manipulative experiments cannot because they
                  alter ecosystems on a larger scale, for longer time periods,
                  and remove both organisms and their cues from the environment.
                  We examined shifts in population size structure, vertical
                  zonation, and use of emersed refuge habitats outside tidepools
                  by the abundant herbivorous black turban snail Tegula
                  funebralis, both before and after the successive mortalities
                  of two predatory sea stars. The small cryptic predator
                  Leptasterias spp. suffered a localized but extreme mortality
                  event in November 2010, followed by two mass mortalities of
                  the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus in August 2011 and
                  autumn 2013. After the local extinction of Leptasterias, the
                  population size of Tegula more than doubled. Also, since
                  Leptasterias primarily inhabited only mid to low intertidal
                  tidepools at this site, small and medium sized snails (which
                  are preferred by Leptasterias) shifted lower in the intertidal
                  and into tidepools after the mortality of Leptasterias. After
                  the mortality of Pisaster in August 2011, large snails did not
                  shift lower in the intertidal zone despite being preferred by
                  Pisaster. Small and medium sized snails became denser in the
                  higher zone and outside tidepools, which was not likely due to
                  Pisaster mortality. Previous studies concluded that Pisaster
                  maintained vertical size gradients of snails, but our data
                  implicate the overlooked predator Leptasterias as the primary
                  cause. This natural experiment indicated that (1) predators
                  exert top-down control over prey population sizes and lower
                  limits, (2) vertical zonation of prey are dynamic and
                  controlled in part by prey behavior, and (3) predators exert
                  the strongest effects on more vulnerable individuals, which
                  typically inhabit stressful habitats higher on the shore or
                  outside tidepools to avoid predation. Because the mass
                  mortalities of two predators drastically reduced both the
                  predation pressure and the chemical cues of predators in the
                  environment, we were able to investigate both the effects of
                  predators on prey populations and the effects on mobile prey
                  behavior.},

                  may affect how these defenses contribute to population and
                  community regulation. For instance, inducible defenses may
                  play larger roles in primary producer populations that are
                  sensitive to low levels of grazing than populations that only
                  respond to high levels of grazing. Although the incidence of
                  herbivore-induced defenses is well documented, and there are
                  examples of geographic variation in these defenses, we have
                  limited knowledge of the factors that affect sensitivity to
                  grazing (i.e., the minimum grazer density needed to elicit
                  these responses) within and among populations. Filling this
                  gap is necessary to understand the importance of these
                  defenses under different conditions. To address whether the
                  sensitivity of seaweed induced defenses varies geographically,
                  we exposed Northern and Southern California populations of the
                  seaweed Silvetia compressa to five densities of the snail
                  Tegula funebralis, under ambient, regional environmental
                  conditions. Southern seaweeds required high levels of grazing
                  to induce defenses, while all levels of herbivory decreased
                  Northern seaweed palatability. To better understand these
                  different responses to low levels of grazing, we conducted
                  common garden experiments to directly test the roles of
                  experimental environment and herbivore source. Consistent with
                  initial experiments, Northern Silvetia responded to low levels
                  of grazing, regardless of environmental conditions, while
                  Southern Silvetia never responded to low levels of grazing,
                  even after being acclimated to Northern environmental
                  conditions for 24 d. Additionally, Southern Silvetia did not
                  respond to grazing by Northern snails, suggesting that
                  herbivore source did not explain this geographic pattern in
                  inducible seaweed defenses. Together, these observations
                  suggest that the seaweed source explains this geographic
                  pattern in sensitivity. Trade-offs with constitutive defenses
                  did not help explain this pattern, as Southern Silvetia had
                  weaker constitutive defenses than Northern seaweeds. This may
                  be due to a combination of low grazing pressure and low
                  predictability of attack in the South. Thus, population
                  variation in sensitivity may be due to long-term differences
                  in environmental histories, resulting in local adaptation or
                  legacy effects from exposure to local conditions. Overall, our
                  results indicate that these herbivore-induced responses may be
                  more important in Northern Silvetia populations than Southern
                  ones.},

                  Moreover, historical estimates of body size that rely on
                  museum specimens may be biased towards larger size classes
                  because of collector preferences, and thus size thresholds
                  have been used to focus attention on maximum body size. We
                  tested the consequences of sampling design, ecological
                  covariates, and size thresholds on inferences of body-size
                  change using field-contextualized historical records, rather
                  than museum specimens. In 2014-2015, we revisited historical
                  (1947-1963) size-frequency distributions of three gastropods
                  (Tegula funebralis, Lottia digitalis/L. austrodigitalis,
                  Littorina keenae) in the context of population density and
                  tidal height. In general, gastropods declined in size.
                  However, our inferences regarding body-size decline were
                  tempered when the variation between sampling units was taken
                  into consideration, resulting in greater uncertainty around
                  the estimate of proportional change in body size. Gastropod
                  size was correlated with population density and tidal height,
                  and these relationships varied over time. Finally, the
                  magnitude and direction of body-size change varied with the

                  indirect calorimetry is expanded to incorporate the
                  thermochemistry of aerobic and anoxic metabolism in living
                  cells and organisms. Calorimetric studies done under normoxia
                  as well as under physiological and environmental anoxia are
                  presented and assessed in terms of ATP turnover rate. Present
                  evidence suggests that unknown sources of energy in freshwater
                  and marine invertebrates under long‐term anoxia may be
                  important.During physiological hypoxia, thermodynamically
                  grossly inefficient pathways sustain high metabolic rates for
                  brief periods. On the contrary, under long‐term environmental
                  anoxia, low steady‐state heat dissipation is linked to the
                  more efficient succinate, propionate, and acetate pathways. In
                  the second part of this paper these relationships are
                  discussed in the context of linear, irreversible
                  thermodynamics. The calorimetric and biochemical trends during
                  aerobic‐anoxic transitions are consistent with thermodynamic
                  optimum functions of catabolic pathways. The theory predicts a
                  decrease of rate with an increase of thermodynamic efficiency;
                  therefore maximum rate and maximum efficiency are mutually
                  exclusive. Cellular changes of pH and adenylate
                  phosphorylation potential are recognized as regulatory
                  mechanisms in the energetic switching to propionate
                  production. While enzyme kinetics provides one key for
                  understanding metabolic regulation, our insight remains
                  incomplete without a complementary thermodynamic analysis of
                  kinetic control in energetically coupled pathways.},

  abstract     = {The cellular stress response (CSR) is critical for enabling
                  organisms to cope with thermal damage to proteins, nucleic
                  acids, and membranes. It is a graded response whose properties
                  vary with the degree of cellular damage. Molecular damage has
                  positive, as well as negative, function-perturbing effects.
                  Positive effects include crucial regulatory interactions that
                  orchestrate involvement of the different components of the
                  CSR. Thermally unfolded proteins signal for rapid initiation
                  of transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs),
                  central elements of the heat shock response (HSR). Thermal
                  disruption of messenger RNA (mRNA) secondary structures in
                  untranslated regions leads to the culling of the mRNA pool:
                  thermally labile mRNAs for housekeeping proteins are degraded
                  by exonucleases; heat-resistant mRNAs for stress proteins like
                  HSPs then can monopolize the translational apparatus. Thus,
                  proteins and RNA function as "cellular thermometers," and
                  evolved differences in their thermal stabilities enable rapid
                  initiation of the CSR whenever cell temperature rises
                  significantly above the normal thermal range of a species.
                  Covalent DNA damage, which may result from increased
                  production of reactive oxygen species, is
                  temperature-dependent; its extent may determine cellular
                  survival. High levels of stress that exceed capacities for
                  molecular repair can lead to proteolysis, inhibition of cell
                  division, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Onset of
                  these processes may occur later in the stress period, after
                  initiation of the HSR, to allow HSPs opportunity to restore
                  protein homeostasis. Delay of these energy costly processes
                  may also result from shortfalls in availability of adenosine
                  triphosphate and reducing power during times of peak stress.},

                  investigation and ultimately shell choice were examined in two
                  inter-tidal hermit crabs, Pagurus samuelis and P.
                  hirsutiusculus. Each species displayed a different preference
                  for either Tegula funebralis shells ( P. samuelis ) or Nucella
                  canaliculata shells ( P. hirsutiusculus ), shells that differ
                  greatly in their external appearance and internal
                  configuration. Visual and chemical shell stimuli were found to
                  have a different effect on each of the two closely related
                  species. Pagurus samuelis relied on visual cues for shell
                  detection. It also displayed visually-mediated tracking of
                  objects resembling T. funebralis shells in colour, shape and
                  size. Pagurus hirsutiusculus did not display tracking
                  behaviour. Both species responded to the chemical composition
                  of shells, specifically their calcium content. Various
                  coatings were applied to the shell surfaces to remove (cover)
                  the calcium cue. For P. hirsutiusculus only, shell exploratory
                  behaviour was not initiated if this one stimulus was absent.
                  Both species were found to rely on the chemical cues alone to
                  locate and uncover partially buried shells. Each species
                  apparently relies on shell cues that are distinguishing
                  features of their preferred shells. Thus, underlying
                  differences in sensory and other neural mechanisms enable each
                  species to detect quickly and respond to its preferred shell
                  type. The stimulus value of the aperture and possible
                  importance of the shell's internal configuration, for shell
                  selection, were also examined. Lastly, the role of learning in
                  shell selection is discussed.},

                  using a mass-marking technique showed that most snails found

                  characteristics of the two habitats. Experiments in 1978 with

                  shape organismal functions and population dynamics as the
                  world warms. Reef-building corals are sensitive to temperature
                  due to their endosymbiotic relationship with single-celled
                  dinoflagellates, with mass mortality events increasing in
                  frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this study was to
                  quantify the thermal sensitivity of important physiological
                  functions of a Caribbean reef-building coral, Orbicella
                  franksi, through the measurement of thermal performance curves
                  (TPCs). We compared TPC metrics (thermal optimum, critical
                  maximum, activation energy, deactivation energy, and rate at a
                  standardized temperature) between two populations at the
                  northern and southern extents of the geographic range of O.
                  franksi. We further compared essential coral organismal
                  processes (gross photosynthesis, respiration, and
                  calcification) within a site to determine which function is
                  most sensitive to thermal stress using a hierarchical
                  Bayesian-modeling approach. We found evidence for differences
                  in thermal performance, which could be due to thermal
                  adaptation or acclimatization, with higher TPC metrics
                  (thermal optimum and critical maximum) in warmer Panama,
                  compared to cooler Bermuda. We also documented the hierarchy
                  in thermal sensitivity of essential organismal functions
                  within a population: respiration was less sensitive than
                  photosynthesis, which was less sensitive than calcification.
                  Understanding thermal performance of corals is essential for
                  projecting coral reef futures, given that key biological
                  functions necessary to sustain coral reef ecosystems are
                  thermally mediated.},

                  phylogenetic and geographical distribution of limpet-like
                  gastropods specialized for life on the coiled shells of other
                  gastropods and hermit crabs were surveyed. Predation-related
                  traits were measured to evaluate the refugial status of shells
                  as habitats from predation. There are 41 shallow-water marine
                  shell-specialized limpets, all members of the Lottiidae,
                  Calyptraeidae and Hipponicidae, which account for 3.5\% of the
                  global diversity of shallow-water marine limpet-like
                  gastropods. These species are distributed mainly along
                  tropical and some temperate coastlines but are notably few in
                  the highly diverse Indo-West Pacific. The northeast Pacific
                  stands out as the region with the most diverse and most
                  host-specific shell-dwelling limpets. As expected, limpets on
                  shells have shells with little or no external sculpture, all
                  traits associated with low predation risk. Hermit crabs are
                  hosts to specialized limpets living inside their shells, but
                  no limpet specializes on the exteriors of hermit-crab shells.
                  Immobile encrusting and shell-extending epibionts (hydrozoans,
                  anthozoans, sponges and bryozoans) often specialize on
                  hermit-crab hosts. Comparisons between these epibionts and
                  shell-dwelling limpets indicate that specialization for life
                  on shells is greatest when the host takes an active role in
                  attracting or moving organisms to their shells. This
                  highlights the important role of behavior in modifying the
                  direction and extent of natural selection in host–guest
                  associations.},

                  thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the
                  perturbations. Consequently, disturbances within the typical
                  range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large,
                  infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little
                  long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We
                  argue that more serious ecological consequences result from
                  compounded perturbations within the normative recovery time of
                  the community in question. We consider both physically based
                  disturbance (for example, storm, volcanic eruption, and forest
                  fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such
                  as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their
                  interactions. Dispersal capability and measures of generation
                  time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest
                  seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and
                  frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems.
                  We develop six scenarios that describe communities that have
                  been subjected to multiple perturbations, either
                  simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery,
                  and appear to have entered new domains or “ecological
                  surprises.” In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to
                  have been required to initiate the changed state. We argue
                  that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthropogenic impacts
                  on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty
                  of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological
                  surprises will become more common. Understanding these
                  ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental
                  management decisions of the 21st century.},

                  intention in these books was to illustrate his ideas of how
                  knowledge and understanding might advance, at least one modern
                  biologist (C. Darwin) has recognized Aristotle's depth and

                  the ongoing attention that his works continue to receive,

                  This review identifies 38 peer-reviewed papers on various

                  published during the last 50 years. These papers are described

                  that pose challenges for physiological activity. Variations in
                  temperature, hydrostatic pressure, and salinity have potential
                  to disrupt structures, and functions of all molecular systems
                  on which life depends. During evolution, sequences of nucleic
                  acids and proteins are adaptively modified to "fit" these
                  macromolecules for function under the particular abiotic
                  conditions of the habitat. Complementing these macromolecular
                  adaptations are alterations in compositions of solutions that
                  bathe macromolecules and affect stabilities of their higher
                  order structures. A primary result of these "micromolecular"
                  adaptations is preservation of optimal balances between
                  conformational rigidity and flexibility of macromolecules.
                  Micromolecular adaptations involve several families of organic
                  osmolytes, with varying effects on macromolecular stability. A
                  given type of osmolyte generally has similar effects on DNA,
                  RNA, proteins and membranes; thus, adaptive regulation of
                  cellular osmolyte pools has a global effect on macromolecules.
                  These effects are mediated largely through influences of
                  osmolytes and macromolecules on water structure and activity.
                  Acclimatory micromolecular responses are often critical in
                  enabling organisms to cope with environmental changes during
                  their lifetimes, for example, during vertical migration in the
                  water column. A species' breadth of environmental tolerance
                  may depend on how effectively it can vary the osmolyte
                  composition of its cellular fluids in the face of stress.
                  Micromolecular adaptations remain an under-appreciated aspect
                  of evolution and acclimatization. Further study can lead to a
                  better understanding of determinants of environmental
                  tolerance ranges and to biotechnological advances in designing
                  improved stabilizers for biological materials.},

                  samuelis (Stimpson), P. hirsutiusculus venturensis (Coffin),
                  P. granosimanus (Stimpson) and P. hemphilli (Benedict), when
                  aerially exposed, corresponded with their pattern of
                  intertidal vertical zonation. The highest occurring species,
                  P. samuelis, exhibited significantly greater tendencies to
                  aggregate with other individuals and to seek refuge in shaded
                  locations and usually remained within their shells when
                  exposed to the combined stresses of temperature and
                  desiccation. P. hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus, primarily
                  mid- to low-intertidal species, displayed these responses only
                  occasionally while P. hemphilli, a lowintertidal and
                  shallow-subtidal species, showed significantly lower
                  clustering, shade attraction, and shell abandonment responses.
                  Comparison of larger and smaller P. samuelis revealed no
                  significant behavioral differences.P. samuelis and P.
                  granosimanus that occupied shells not allowing complete
                  retraction were less resistant to the stresses of aerial
                  exposure. Crabs inhabiting damaged shells with holes ( ≈ 5 mm
                  diam.) in the whorls or spire did not experience decreased
                  survival in comparison with that found in crabs occupying
                  entire shells.These findings suggest an implication of shell
                  optimality with environmental resistance that should be
                  considered of potential importance in the evolution of complex
                  communicative and aggressive behavior in intertidal hermit
                  crabs. In addition, attraction to shaded areas and clustering
                  are behavioral responses appropriate for avoiding or reducing
                  the adverse effects of temperature and desiccation stresses.
                  These responses may be important in facilitating the
                  coexistence of these species although further investigation is
                  needed to quantify the importance of such behavior to
                  intertidal hermit crab populations. The significance of
                  shell-exiting is not specifically known but survival of a
                  shell-less crab is undoubtedly minimal.},

                  (PP) in persons with diabetes (DM) and loss of protective
                  sensation (LOPS). However, they are handmade, leading to
                  inconsistent effectiveness. If foot structure changes over
                  time, high PP-locations also change. To address this,
                  individualized algorithm based 3D-printed rockers and
                  self-adjusting pressure-reducing insoles are applied. METHODS:
                  PP across seven foot regions was analyzed in 21 persons with
                  DM and LOPS. Regions with PP < 200 kPa were considered not at
                  risk (RnoR); regions with PP ≥ 200 kPa at risk (RaR). The aim
                  was to offload RaR, while remaining PP < 200 kPa in RnoR.
                  RESULTS: Individualized rockers and self-adjusting insoles
                  combined successfully reduce PP < 200 kPa (on average 24 \% -
                  48 \%) in all feet with toes, central and lateral forefoot
                  identified as RaR. Same intervention reduces PP in 68 \% of
                  the feet with medial forefoot identified as RaR. With the heel
                  as RaR, no intervention reduces PP successfully in all feet.
                  CONCLUSIONS: Individualized 3D-printed rockers combined with
                  self-adjusting insoles reduce PP (< 200 kPa) in toes, central
                  and lateral forefoot, but not in heels. Alternative insoles
                  with medial arch support, heel cup and compliant midsole
                  materials might enhance success rate across entire foot.},

  abstract     = {The Q10 temperature coefficient, which is widely used in
                  scientific literature, is a measure of the temperature
                  sensitivity of chemical reaction rates or biological
                  processes. However, the conclusions drawn from applying this
                  coefficient to experimental data obtained from biological
                  processes are not universal. In many biological processes, Q10
                  values are often discordant with the results predicted by the
                  Arrhenius law. The hypothesis tested in the present study is
                  that this problem arises mainly from the fact that the Q10
                  coefficient is defined by the ratio between rates described by
                  exponential laws instead of power laws. Considering this
                  hypothesis and the need to review the mathematical laws and
                  models currently used to describe rates and Q10 coefficients,
                  we propose a model beyond the usual Arrhenius theory or
                  exponential decay law herein. The proposed mathematical model
                  is based on the theory of deformed exponential functions, with
                  the ordinary Q10 model representing the conventional
                  exponential function. Therefore, all results following the
                  standard model remain valid. Moreover, we include a Q10 free
                  open-source code, written in Python, and compatible with
                  Windows, Linux and macOS platforms. The validation of the
                  proposed model and confirmation of the given hypothesis were

                  biological processes: soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition
                  (which is essential to forecast the impact of climate change
                  on terrestrial ecosystems); the metabolism of Arctic
                  zooplankton; physiological processes of the respiratory and

  abstract     = {Ecological patterns are determined by the interplay between
                  abiotic factors and interactions among species. As the Earth's
                  climate warms, interactions such as competition, predation,
                  and mutualism are changing due to shifts in per capita
                  interaction strength and the relative abundance of interacting
                  species. Changes in interspecific relationships, in turn, can
                  drive important local-scale changes in community dynamics,
                  biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, and can potentially
                  alter large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance. In
                  many cases, the importance of indirect effects of warming,
                  mediated by changing species interactions, will be
                  greater—albeit less well understood—than direct effects in
                  determining the community- and ecosystem-level outcomes of
                  global climate change. Despite considerable community-specific
                  idiosyncrasy, ecological theory and a growing body of data
                  suggest that certain general trends are emerging at local
                  scales: positive interactions tend to become more prevalent
                  with warming, and top trophic levels are disproportionately
                  vulnerable. In addition, important ecological changes result
                  when the geographic overlap between species changes, and when
                  the seasonal timing of life history events of interacting
                  species falls into or out of synchrony. We assess the degree
                  to which such changes are predictable, and urge advancement on
                  several high priority questions surrounding the relationships
                  between temperature and community ecology. An improved
                  understanding of how assemblages of multiple, interacting
                  species will respond to climate change is imperative if we
                  hope to effectively prepare for and adapt to its effects.},

                  from calcium carbonate are expected to show increased
                  difficulties growing and maintaining their skeletons under
                  ocean acidification (OA). Any loss of shell integrity
                  increases vulnerability, as shells provide protection against
                  predation, desiccation, and disease. Not all species show the
                  same responses to OA, which may be due to the composition and
                  microstructural arrangement of their shells. We explore the
                  role of shell composition and microstructure in resisting
                  dissolution caused by decreases in seawater pH using a
                  combination of microCT scans, XRD analysis, and SEM imaging.
                  Two gastropods with different shell compositions and
                  microstructure, Tegula funebralis and Nucella ostrina, were
                  exposed to simulated ocean acidification conditions for six
                  months. Both species showed signs of dissolution on the
                  exterior of their shells, but changes in density were
                  significantly more pronounced in T. funebralis. XRD analysis
                  indicated that the exterior layer of both shell types was made
                  of calcite. T. funebralis may be more prone to dissolution
                  because their outer fibrous calcite layer has more crystal
                  edges and faces exposed, potentially increasing the surface
                  area on which dissolution can occur. These results support a
                  previous study where T. funebralis showed significant
                  decreases in both shell growth and strength, but N. ostrina
                  only showed slight reductions in shell strength, and
                  unaffected growth. We suggest that microstructural arrangement

                  regulate intracellular pH (pH(i)) within a range that is
                  compatible with cellular metabolism. Plants, animals, and

                  activities such as feeding, growth and reproduction. In
                  temperate regions, this seasonality is typically correlated
                  with coincident cycles in photoperiod, temperature and food
                  availability and it can be difficult to determine which of
                  these environmental factors is the key driver. Polar regions
                  are characterised by greatly reduced seasonal variation in
                  temperature, and an enhanced seasonality of food availability;
                  they therefore form a natural laboratory for distinguishing
                  the ecological effects of food from those of temperature.
                  Here, we report a study of the common shallow water urchin
                  Sterechinus neumayeri from Rothera Point, Antarctica. This
                  species exhibits a marked seasonal variation in metabolic rate
                  and feeding activity (which ceases completely in winter). In
                  this study the metabolic rate of urchins collected in late
                  winter and held in the laboratory without food was compared
                  with that of wild urchins undertaking the transition to summer
                  feeding and growth. Starved urchins showed a small rise in
                  metabolic rate in summer which could be explained entirely by
                  the small increase in temperature (Q(10)=2.5). At the same
                  time, the wild population showed a much larger increase in
                  metabolic rate related largely to the costs of feeding and
                  growth. Rates of nitrogen excretion were also much larger in
                  wild urchins, and the O:N atomic ratio indicated that starved
                  urchins were depending to a greater extent on lipid and
                  carbohydrate. Gut mass and test organic content showed no
                  change in starved urchins, indicating that metabolic substrate
                  was being provided by the gonad. The data suggest that in wild
                  S. neumayeri only 15-20\% of the summer increase in metabolism
                  is caused directly by the temperature rise whereas 80-85\% is
                  caused by increased physiological activity associated with
                  feeding, growth and spawning.},

                  experience and water flow on hermit crab shell selection.
                  Research at Bodega Bay, California, examined shell selection
                  in Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson) and Pagurus samuelis
                  (Stimpson) as a function of previous shell occupancy.
                  Laboratory experiments found that when Pagurus granosimanus
                  was presented two weight-matched shells of Olivella biplicata
                  (Sowerby) and Tegula funebralis (Adams), it was significantly
                  more likely to choose the shell species that it was collected
                  in. Survey data yielded different shell use patterns between
                  Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis, with Pagurus
                  samuelis using almost exclusively Tegula funebralis and
                  Pagurus granosimanus using Olivella biplicata and Tegula
                  funebralis at one site while using Tegula brunnea (Philippi)
                  at another site. It was also found that Pagurus granosimanus
                  is found deeper in the intertidal than Pagurus samuelis.
                  Research conducted on Mo'orea, French Polynesia, examined the
                  effect of water flow on shell selection by hermit crabs.
                  Population surveys and laboratory experiments were combined to
                  determine if Calcinus seurati (Forest) from high flow and low
                  flow environments select shells of different weight. It was
                  found that Calcinus seurati collected from a high flow site
                  selected significantly heavier shells than those collected
                  from the still water site. Laboratory experiments also showed
                  a tendency for Calcinus seurati to select heavier shells in a
                  high flow treatment than in a no flow treatment. Reef crest
                  populations of Calcinus gaimardii (Edwards) and Calcinus
                  elegans (Edwards) were also surveyed and compared with
                  Calcinus seurati survey data. A significant difference in
                  shell weight was found between Calcinus gaimardii and Calcinus
                  seurati from the still water site. No other significant
                  differences were found among species. Regression analyses
                  indicate a correlation between hermit crab weight and shell
                  weight for all three Mo'orean species.},

                  thermal sensitivity of performance in ectotherms has become a
                  major focus of research programs in evolutionary physiology.
                  Graphical and mathematical models describe how the
                  relationship between body temperature and performance, termed
                  the performance function, should evolve in response to the
                  thermal environment. Interspecific comparisons of the thermal
                  sensitivity of locomotor performance have revealed that the
                  performance function is evolutionarily labile in some taxa but
                  is more conservative in others. A lack of heritable variation
                  or weak selection on performance may explain the conservation
                  of thermal physiology in certain groups, but evolutionary
                  trade-offs do not appear to have been important constraints.
                  Other aspects of thermal physiology, such as the thermal
                  sensitivity of growth rate, have evolved rapidly in
                  ectotherms. Despite the apparent lability of thermal
                  physiology in some taxa, there is limited evidence that
                  thermoregulatory behavior and thermal physiology are
                  coadapted. Future studies should broaden taxonomic and
                  phenotypic foci, while paying close attention to the

                  Here, we demonstrate that the calcification rates of the
                  edible mussel (Mytilus edulis) and Pacific oyster (Crassostrea

                  oyster calcification may decrease by 25 and 10\%,

                  the Pacific Ocean with respect to aragonite and calcite. The
                  upward migrations of the aragonite and calcite saturation
                  horizons, averaging about 1 to 2 m yr−1, are the direct result
                  of the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the oceans and regional
                  changes in circulation and biogeochemical processes. The
                  shoaling of the saturation horizon is regionally variable,
                  with more rapid shoaling in the South Pacific where there is a

                  determined by wind-driven coastal upwelling, with an ecosystem
                  that is tightly coupled to seasonality in this upwelling.
                  Three decades of data measured over the California shelf at
                  NOAA buoys are used to describe the seasonal variability of
                  the winds that force upwelling and the response of the coastal
                  ocean in terms of sea temperature. Moreover, seasonal patterns
                  in surface chlorophyll and alongshore currents are determined
                  from one decade of data. In addition to clear seasonality, all
                  these data exhibit distinct spatial and non-seasonal temporal
                  variability in upwelling. Based on alongshore wind stress
                  characteristics in central and north California, three seasons
                  are defined: Upwelling Season (April-June) with strong
                  upwelling-favorable winds and large standard deviation due to
                  frequent reversals; Relaxation Season (July-September) with
                  weak equatorward winds and low variability; and Storm Season
                  (December-February) characterized by weak mean wind stress but
                  large variability. The remaining months are transitional,
                  falling into one or other season in different years. In
                  addition to large-scale latitudinal differences in wind
                  stress, spatial differences are associated with coastal
                  topography - specifically the acceleration of wind downstream
                  of capes. Latitudinal differences in sea surface temperature
                  depend on wind stress, both local and large-scale, but also on
                  surface heating and offshore influences. Intra-annual and
                  inter-annual anomalies in wind and sea surface temperature are
                  associated with variability in coastal winds, large-scale
                  winds, and offshore basin-scale ocean conditions. Satellite
                  chlorophyll concentration shows an optimal window relation
                  with upwelling forcing, allowing maximum concentrations during
                  moderate winds and minimal during poor or strong winds.},

                  site of daily temperature measurements since the original
                  structure was built in 1916. The time series is the longest
                  continuous record of temperature on the Pacific Rim and is
                  frequently cited as an indicator of ocean temperature trends
                  in the region. The over 100-year long record of daily surface
                  temperature and slightly shorter bottom temperature data are
                  presented here, with adjustment for bias owing to changes in
                  sampling time of day. Data were generally collected near 8:00
                  a.m. in the early years, when water temperatures are cooler,
                  and gradually shifted later in the day, when temperatures are
                  warmer. In addition, cold surges from irregular internal tidal
                  bores complicated attempts to estimate daily heating-cooling
                  cycles solely as a function of time of day. To isolate the
                  effect of the solar heating cycle, adjustments were calculated
                  based on seasonally variable diurnal solar heating using a
                  surface ocean heating model and locally measured insolation
                  data. Although the observed warming trends in nearshore
                  temperatures are reduced by about 0.2 °C per century in the
                  adjusted data, they still retain a significant increase of
                  1.24 °C per century at the surface and 1.67 °C per century in
                  bottom waters.},

                  particular interest, because during ontogeny size changes and

                  based on first principles of allometry and biochemical
                  kinetics, that predicts the time of ontogenetic development as
                  a function of body mass and temperature. The model fits
                  embryonic development times spanning a wide range of egg sizes
                  and incubation temperatures for birds and aquatic ectotherms
                  (fish, amphibians, aquatic insects and zooplankton). The model
                  also describes nearly 75\% of the variation in post-embryonic
                  development among a diverse sample of zooplankton. The

                  concentrations are reducing ocean pH and carbonate ion
                  concentrations, and thus the level of calcium carbonate
                  saturation. Experimental evidence suggests that if these
                  trends continue, key marine organisms--such as corals and some
                  plankton--will have difficulty maintaining their external
                  calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the
                  ocean-carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation
                  under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future
                  emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections,
                  Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become
                  undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of
                  calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this
                  undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern
                  Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live

                  spatiotemporal variability in carbonate chemistry. We found
                  that biological processes were the primary drivers of local pH

                  ocean acidification, because their fragile aragonite shells
                  are susceptible to increasing ocean acidity. While short-term
                  incubations have demonstrated that pteropod calcification is
                  negatively impacted by ocean acidification, we know little
                  about net calcification in response to varying ocean
                  conditions in natural populations. Here, we examine in situ
                  calcification of Limacina helicina pteropods collected from
                  the California Current Ecosystem, a coastal upwelling system
                  with strong spatial gradients in ocean carbonate chemistry,
                  dissolved oxygen and temperature. Depth-averaged pH ranged
                  from 8.03 in warmer offshore waters to 7.77 in cold CO2-rich
                  waters nearshore. Based on high-resolution micro-CT
                  technology, we showed that shell thickness declined by ~ 37\%
                  along the upwelling gradient from offshore to nearshore water.
                  Dissolution marks covered only ~ 2\% of the shell surface area
                  and were not associated with the observed variation in shell
                  thickness. We thus infer that pteropods make thinner shells
                  where upwelling brings more acidified and colder waters to the
                  surface. Probably the thinner shells do not result from
                  enhanced dissolution, but are due to a decline in
                  calcification. Reduced calcification of pteropods is likely to
                  have major ecological and biogeochemical implications for the
                  cycling of calcium carbonate in the oceans.},

  abstract     = {AbstractLong-term ocean time series have proven to be the most
                  robust approach for direct observation of climate change
                  processes such as Ocean Acidification. The California
                  Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program
                  has collected quarterly samples for seawater inorganic carbon
                  since 1983. The longest time series is at CalCOFI line 90
                  station 90 from 1984–present, with a gap from 2002 to 2008.
                  Here we present the first analysis of this 37- year time
                  series, the oldest in the Pacific. Station 90.90 exhibits an
                  unambiguous acidification signal in agreement with the global
                  surface ocean (decrease in pH of −0.0015 ± 0.0001 yr−1), with
                  a distinct seasonal cycle driven by temperature and total
                  dissolved inorganic carbon. This provides direct evidence that
                  the unique carbon chemistry signature (compared to other long
                  standing time series) results in a reduced uptake rate of
                  carbon dioxide (CO2) due to proximity to a mid-latitude
                  eastern boundary current upwelling zone. Comparison to an
                  independent empirical model estimate and climatology at the
                  same location reveals regional differences not captured in the
                  existing models.},

                  impacts on marine ecosystems over the 21(st) Century.
                  Calcifying organisms have exhibited reduced calcification

                  the in situ sensitivity of calcifying ecosystems to future

                  CO2-induced acidification caused by natural respiration in an

                  net calcium carbonate dissolution under more acidic

                  sensitivity to ocean acidification, nighttime dissolution in
                  these intertidal ecosystems could more than double by 2050,

                  offshore dispersive stage that can last weeks or months. We
                  tested the effects that ocean acidification from elevated
                  levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) could have on the
                  ability of larvae to detect olfactory cues from adult

                  8.15) discriminated between a range of cues that could help
                  them locate reef habitat and suitable settlement sites. This
                  discriminatory ability was disrupted when larvae were reared
                  in conditions simulating CO(2)-induced ocean acidification.
                  Larvae became strongly attracted to olfactory stimuli they

                  occur ca. 2100 (pH 7.8) and they no longer responded to any

                  systems, we compile, organize, and analyze a database of 1,072
                  thermal responses for microbes, plants, and animals. The
                  unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n =
                  309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all
                  major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel
                  features of the temperature response of biological traits. In
                  particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species
                  (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87\% are fit well by
                  the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for
                  these rises is 0.66 ± 0.05 eV, similar to the reported
                  across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV. However,
                  systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation
                  energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right
                  skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists
                  across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and
                  habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having
                  increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to
                  predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner
                  principle-stronger selection on running for your life than
                  running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat
                  (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the
                  mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not
                  variation around the mean. The distribution of activation
                  energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 ± 0.39 eV
                  (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed.
                  Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the
                  thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a

                  variability in the community and ultimately maintain
                  diversity. Although it is recognized that global change will
                  affect environmental disturbance regimes, our understanding of
                  the community dynamics governing ecosystem recovery and the
                  maintenance of functional diversity in future scenarios is
                  very limited. Here, we use one of the few ecosystems naturally
                  exposed to future scenarios of environmental change to examine
                  disturbance and recovery dynamics. We examine the recovery
                  patterns of marine species from a physical disturbance across
                  different acidification regimes caused by volcanic CO2 vents.
                  Plots of shallow rocky reef were cleared of all species in
                  areas of ambient, low, and extreme low pH that correspond to
                  near-future and extreme scenarios for ocean acidification. Our
                  results illustrate how acidification decreases the variability
                  of communities, resulting in homogenization and reduced
                  functional diversity at a landscape scale. Whereas the
                  recovery trajectories in ambient pH were highly variable and
                  resulted in a diverse range of assemblages, recovery was more
                  predictable with acidification and consistently resulted in
                  very similar algal-dominated assemblages. Furthermore, low pH
                  zones had fewer signs of biological disturbance (primarily sea
                  urchin grazing) and increased recovery rates of the dominant
                  taxa (primarily fleshy algae). Together, our results highlight
                  how environmental change can cause ecosystem simplification
                  via environmentally mediated changes in community dynamics in
                  the near future, with cascading impacts on functional
                  diversity and ecosystem function.},

                  species and ecosystems, thereby extending baselines for modern
                  management. We bring together paleoecological, archaeological,
                  and modern clam records to explore the relationship between
                  humans and butter clams (Saxidomus gigantea) throughout the

                  Canada. We compare butter clam size and growth patterns from
                  different temporal, environmental, and cultural contexts
                  spanning 11,500 y to present. Butter clam size and growth were
                  restricted in early postglacial times but increased over the
                  next few millennia. During the early-Late Holocene, humans
                  took increasing advantage of robust clam populations and after
                  3.5 ka, began constructing clam gardens (intertidal
                  rock-walled terraces). Environmental and cultural variables,
                  including coarse substrate, stabilized sea surface
                  temperature, and the presence of a clam garden wall, increased
                  clam growth throughout the Holocene. Measurements of clams
                  collected in active clam gardens and deposited in middens
                  suggest that clam gardens as well as other mariculture
                  activities enhanced clam production despite increased
                  harvesting pressure. Since European contact, decline of
                  traditional management practices and increases in industrial
                  activities are associated with reduced clam size and growth
                  similar to those of the early postglacial clams. Deeper-time
                  baselines that more accurately represent clam population
                  variability and allow us to assess magnitudes of change
                  throughout time as well as the complex interactions among
                  humans and clams are useful for modern marine resource

                  varieties exhibiting resilience to acidification stress. We
                  experimentally compared the effects of OA on two populations
                  of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), a marine mollusc
                  important to fisheries and global aquaculture. Results from
                  our experiments simulating captive aquaculture conditions
                  demonstrated that abalone sourced from a strong upwelling
                  region were tolerant of ongoing OA, whereas a captive-raised
                  population sourced from a region of weaker upwelling exhibited
                  significant mortality and vulnerability to OA. This difference
                  was linked to population-specific variation in the maternal
                  provisioning of lipids to offspring, with a positive
                  correlation between lipid concentrations and survival under
                  OA. This relationship also persisted in experiments on
                  second-generation animals, and larval lipid consumption rates
                  varied among paternal crosses, which is consistent with the
                  presence of genetic variation for physiological traits
                  relevant for OA survival. Across experimental trials, growth
                  rates differed among family lineages, and the highest
                  mortality under OA occurred in the fastest growing crosses.
                  Identifying traits that convey resilience to OA is critical to
                  the continued success of abalone and other shellfish
                  production, and these mitigation efforts should be
                  incorporated into breeding programs for commercial and
                  restoration aquaculture.},

                  microbial diversity patterns observed across disparate systems
                  and scales. Here we established a quantitative model to
                  incorporate pH into metabolic theory to capture and explain

                  validated our newly developed models across multiple scales of
                  ecological organization. At the species level, we modeled the
                  diversification rate of the model bacterium Pseudomonas
                  fluorescens evolving under laboratory media gradients varying
                  in temperature and pH. At the community level, we modeled
                  patterns of bacterial communities in paddy soils across a
                  continental scale, which included natural gradients of pH and
                  temperature. Last, we further extended our model at a global
                  scale by integrating a meta-analysis comprising 870 soils
                  collected worldwide from a wide range of ecosystems. Our
                  results were robust in consistently predicting the

                  temperature and pH gradients-with model variation explaining
                  from 7 to 66\% of the variation in bacterial diversity,
                  depending on the scale and system complexity. Together, our

                  bacterial diversity and quantitative models with the potential
                  to be used at distinct spatiotemporal scales. By

                  ecosystems may have played in facilitating the movement of
                  maritime peoples from Asia to the Americas near the end of the
                  Pleistocene. Growing in cool nearshore waters along rocky
                  coastlines, kelp forests offer some of the most productive
                  habitats on earth, with high primary productivity, magnified
                  secondary productivity, and three-dimensional habitat
                  supporting a diverse array of marine organisms. Today,
                  extensive kelp forests are found around the North Pacific from
                  Japan to Baja California. After a break in the tropics?where
                  nearshore mangrove forests and coral reefs are highly
                  productive?kelp forests are also found along the Andean Coast
                  of South America. These Pacific Rim kelp forests support or
                  shelter a wealth of shellfish, fish, marine mammals, seabirds,
                  and seaweeds, resources heavily used historically by coastal
                  peoples. By about 16,000 years ago, the North Pacific Coast
                  offered a linear migration route, essentially unobstructed and
                  entirely at sea level, from northeast Asia into the Americas.
                  Recent reconstructions suggest that rising sea levels early in
                  the postglacial created a highly convoluted and island-rich
                  coast along Beringia's southern shore, conditions highly
                  favorable to maritime hunter-gatherers. Along with the
                  terrestrial resources available in adjacent landscapes, kelp
                  forests and other nearshore habitats sheltered similar suites
                  of food resources that required minimal adaptive adjustments
                  for migrating coastal peoples. With reduced wave energy,
                  holdfasts for boats, and productive fishing, these linear kelp
                  forest ecosystems may have provided a kind of ?kelp highway?
                  for early maritime peoples colonizing the New World.},

                  on individual flexibility and less on genetic differences
                  among populations. None of the narrow-niched species
                  acclimate. The D. willistoni, a moderately broad-niched
                  species, does not acclimate nor show much genetic variation.
                  It is suggested that this species avoids desiccation stress

  abstract     = {The sequence of species observed after a relatively large
                  space is opened up is a consequence of the following
                  mechanisms. "Opportunist" species with broad dispersal powers
                  and rapid growth to maturity usually arrive first and occupy
                  empty space. These species cannot invade and grow in the
                  presence of adults of their own or other species. Several
                  alternative mechanisms may then determine which species
                  replace these early occupants. Three models of such mechanisms
                  have been proposed. The first "facilitation" model suggests
                  that the entry and growth of the later species is dependent
                  upon the earlier species "preparing the ground"; only after
                  this can later species colonize. Evidence in support of this
                  model applies mainly to certain primary successions and in
                  heterotrophic succession. A second "tolerance" model suggests
                  that a predictable sequence is produced by the existence of
                  species that have evolved different strategies for exploiting
                  resources. Later species will be those able to tolerate lower
                  levels of resources than earlier ones. Thus they can invade
                  and grow to maturity in the presence of those that preceded
                  them. At present there exists little evidence in support of
                  this model. A third "inhibition" model suggests that all
                  species resist invasions of competitors. The first occupants
                  preempt the space and will continue to exclude or inhibit
                  later colonists until the former die or are damaged, thus
                  releasing resources. Only then can later colonists reach
                  maturity. A considerable body of evidence exists in support of
                  this model. In the majority of natural communities succession
                  is frequently interrupted by major disturbances, such as
                  fires, storms, insect plagues, etc., starting the process all
                  over again. However, if not interrupted, it eventually reaches
                  a stage in which further change is on a small scale as
                  individuals die and are replaced. The pattern of these changes
                  will depend upon whether individuals are more likely to be
                  replaced by a member of their own or another species. If the
                  former, stability will be assured. However, in terrestrial
                  communities, conditions in the soil in the immediate vicinity
                  of long-lived plants may become modified in such a way that
                  offspring of the same species are much less favored than those
                  of other species. A likely cause is the buildup of
                  host-specific pathogenic soil organisms near a long-lived
                  plant. In this case, the species at each local site keep
                  changing, producing local instability. Whether the average
                  species composition of the whole tract does not change,
                  exhibiting global stability, or whether it keeps changing has
                  not yet been decided for any natural community.},

  abstract     = {We present a model of community regulation that incorporates
                  the effects of abiotic disturbance, predation, competition,
                  and recruitment density. We assume that mobile organisms
                  (i.e., consumers) are more strongly affected by environmental
                  stress than are sessile organisms and that food-web complexity
                  decreases with increasing stress. The model makes three
                  predictions under conditions of high recruitment. First, in
                  stressful environments, consumers have no effect because they
                  are absent or inactive, and competition for space is
                  prevented. Both mobile and sessile organisms are regulated
                  directly by environmental stress. Second, in moderate
                  environments, consumers are still ineffective, but sessile
                  organisms are less affected by stress and frequently attain
                  high densities, leading to competition for space. Finally, in
                  benign environments, consumers prevent competition for space
                  unless the prey can escape a predation bottleneck and reach a
                  high abundance. A reduction in recruitment density reduces the
                  importance of competition for a given level of environmental
                  stress. At top trophic levels, low recruitment slows the rate
                  of population increase, and competition should be less intense
                  even in benign environments. In stressful environments, severe
                  conditions should keep the density of consumers low regardless
                  of recruitment density. Abiotic stress should regulate mobile
                  consumers over a wider range of the environmental gradient
                  with low rather than with high recruitment. At low trophic
                  levels, the importance of competition (including escape
                  competition) should decline with reduced recruitment density
                  regardless of the level of stress. With low recruitment, lower
                  trophic levels should be regulated by physical factors at the
                  severe end of the environmental gradient and by predation at
                  the benign end of the gradient. This model also predicts that
                  when competition for space leads to exclusion and recruitment
                  is high, the relationships between diversity and either
                  predation (the predation hypothesis) or disturbance (the
                  intermediate-disturbance hypothesis) are distinct, not
                  equivalent as is often assumed. We suggest that physical
                  disturbance is distinct from predation (considered equivalent
                  to, but distinct from, biological disturbance). Diversity is
                  low in harsh environments because of the intolerance of all
                  but opportunistic and highly resistant species to such
                  conditions. With environmental moderation, diversity increases
                  because of the intermediate-disturbance effect, decreases
                  because of the competitive-exclusion effect, increases because
                  of the prevention of competitive exclusion by moderate
                  predation, and decreases because of the local extinction of
                  prey by severe predation. Thus, with high recruitment, a
                  bimodal diversity curve is predicted along the axis of
                  environmental stress. If competition permits coexistence or
                  recruitment is low, the diversity curve is predicted to be
                  unimodal. The model should be applicable in all habitats,
                  although some predictions may be altered by differences in the
                  importance of omnivory in terrestrial versus aquatic
                  interaction webs. Testing the model will be difficult, but it
                  is feasible; it will require quantification of local
                  environmental gradients, recruitment densities, food-web
                  structure, and spatial structure. Predictions can be made on
                  the basis of these observations and tested by the
                  determination of community organization using experiments that
                  simultaneously evaluate the effects of the major processes
                  structuring the community. Partial tests from marine habitats
                  support some predictions of the model, but further testing is
                  needed, particularly in nonmarine habitats.},

                  of competition, predation, and disturbance in determining
                  community structure. These systems exhibit considerable
                  regional variability in percentage cover and in the strength
                  of interspecific interactions, which may be due largely to
                  effects of varying larval supply. In Oregon and Washington,
                  experimental studies of space allocation among sessile
                  invertebrates have emphasized the role of benthic processes
                  such as competition and predation. In contrast, studies in
                  central California have emphasized the importance of larval
                  supply. In this article, we identify a gradient in percentage
                  cover in the middle and upper intertidal zone that is
                  consistent with an oceanographically based explanation for
                  these differences: percentage cover of mussels and barnacles
                  is much higher in Oregon, where nearshore circulation promotes
                  high recruitment, than in California, where strong offshore
                  currents inhibit recruitment. A mathematical model
                  incorporating larval transport and interspecific competition
                  for space offers an explanation for the one violation of the
                  hypothesis-higher percentage cover of Chthamalus spp. in
                  California. The findings illustrate that attempts to
                  synthesize regional differences in community structure and
                  dynamics can benefit from considering both the benthic adult
                  and pelagic larval environments.},

                  increase tolerance to a second heterologous stressor, is
                  thought to involve the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsp).
                  We thus investigated the boundaries of cross-tolerance in
                  tidepool sculpins (Oligocottus maculosus) and their
                  relationship to Hsp70 levels. Survival of sculpins exposed to
                  severe osmotic (90 ppt, 2 h) and hypoxic (0.33 mg O(2)/L, 2 h)
                  stressors increased from 68\% to 96\%, and from 47\% to 76\%,
                  respectively, following a +12 degrees C heat shock. The
                  magnitude of this heat shock was critical for protection. A
                  +10 degrees C heat shock did not confer cross-tolerance, while
                  a +15 degrees C heat shock was deleterious. Sculpins required
                  between 8 and 48 h of recovery following the +12 degrees C
                  heat shock to develop cross-tolerance. There was no
                  association between Hsp70 levels before the onset of the
                  secondary stressor and cross-tolerance. However, branchial
                  Hsp70 levels following osmotic shock were highly correlated
                  with the time frame of cross-tolerance. Thus, Hsp70 induction
                  by the priming stressor may be less important than the ability
                  of the cell to mount an Hsp response to subsequent stressors.
                  The time frame of cross-tolerance is similar to the interval
                  between low tides, suggesting the possible relevance of this
                  response in nature.},

                  physiology, at least one fundamental issue remains unresolved:
                  whether the maximal performance of a genotype depends on its
                  optimal temperature. One school argues that warm-adapted
                  genotypes will outperform cold-adapted genotypes because high
                  temperatures inevitably accelerate chemical reactions. Yet
                  another school holds that biochemical adaptation can
                  compensate for thermodynamic effects on performance. Here, we
                  briefly discuss this theoretical debate and then summarize
                  empirical studies that address whether hotter is better. In
                  general, comparative and experimental studies support the view

                  it is advantageous for ectothermic organisms to prefer a body

                  theory works well for many terrestrial organisms but has not
                  been tested for animals inhabiting the hypervariable physical
                  environment of intertidal shores. In laboratory experiments,
                  we allowed the intertidal snail Chlorostoma funebralis to
                  position itself on a temperature gradient, then measured its
                  thermal preference and determined an index of how its
                  performance varied with temperature. Snails performed a biased
                  random walk along the temperature gradient, which, contrary to
                  expectations, caused them to aggregate where body temperature
                  was 15 to 17 °C below their temperature of optimum performance
                  and near the species' lower thermal limit. This "cold-biased"
                  behavioral response may guide snails to refuges in shaded

                  will affect population dynamics and community structure in the
                  future, but our current understanding of the outcomes of
                  species interactions in a high-CO2 world is limited. Here, we
                  draw upon emerging experimental research examining the effects
                  of ocean acidification on coastal molluscs to provide
                  hypotheses of the potential impacts of high-CO2 on
                  predator-prey interactions. Coastal molluscs, such as oysters,
                  mussels, and snails, allocate energy among defenses, growth,
                  and reproduction. Ocean acidification increases the energetic
                  costs of physiological processes such as acid-base regulation
                  and calcification. Impacted molluscs can display complex and
                  divergent patterns of energy allocation to defenses and growth
                  that may influence predator-prey interactions; these include
                  changes in shell properties, body size, tissue mass, immune
                  function, or reproductive output. Ocean acidification has also
                  been shown to induce complex changes in chemoreception,
                  behavior, and inducible defenses, including altered cue
                  detection and predator avoidance behaviors. Each of these
                  responses may ultimately alter the susceptibility of coastal
                  molluscs to predation through effects on predator handling
                  time, satiation, and search time. While many of these effects
                  may manifest as increases in per capita predation rates on
                  coastal molluscs, the ultimate outcome of predator-prey
                  interactions will also depend on how ocean acidification
                  affects the specified predators, which also exhibit complex
                  responses to ocean acidification. Changes in predator-prey
                  interactions could have profound and unexplored consequences
                  for the population dynamics of coastal molluscs in a high-CO2

                  and capacity-limited thermal tolerance, which is inspired by
                  the Fry paradigm of a bell-shaped
                  increase-optimum-decrease-type response of aerobic scope to
                  increasing temperature, but also includes proposed negative
                  and synergistic effects of elevated CO2 levels, has been
                  suggested as a unifying framework. The objectives of this
                  meta-analysis were to assess the following: (i) the generality
                  of a bell-shaped relationship between absolute aerobic scope
                  (AAS) and temperature; (ii) to what extent elevated CO2
                  affects resting oxygen uptake MO2rest and AAS; and (iii)
                  whether there is an interaction between elevated temperature
                  and CO2. The behavioural effects of CO2 are also briefly
                  discussed. In 31 out of 73 data sets (both acutely exposed and
                  acclimated), AAS increased and remained above 90\% of the
                  maximum, whereas a clear thermal optimum was observed in the
                  remaining 42 data sets. Carbon dioxide caused a significant
                  rise in MO2rest in only 18 out of 125 data sets, and a
                  decrease in 25, whereas it caused a decrease in AAS in four
                  out of 18 data sets and an increase in two. The analysis did
                  not reveal clear evidence for an overall correlation with
                  temperature, CO2 regime or duration of CO2 treatment. When CO2
                  had an effect, additive rather than synergistic interactions
                  with temperature were most common and, interestingly, they
                  even interacted antagonistically on MO2rest and AAS. The
                  behavioural effects of CO2 could complicate experimental
                  determination of respiratory performance. Overall, this
                  meta-analysis reveals heterogeneity in the responses to
                  elevated temperature and CO2 that is not in accordance with
                  the idea of a single unifying principle and which cannot be
                  ignored in attempts to model and predict the impacts of global
                  warming and ocean acidification on marine ectotherms.},

                  adaptation), and (iv) pervasive shifts in gene expression (as
                  gauged by using DNA microarray techniques). The vertical
                  zonation observed in rocky intertidal habitats thus may
                  reflect two distinct yet closely related aspects of thermal
                  physiology: (i) intrinsic interspecific differences in
                  temperature sensitivities of physiological systems, which
                  establish thermal optima and tolerance limits for species; and
                  (ii) 'cost of living' considerations arising from sub-lethal
                  perturbation of these physiological systems, which may
                  establish an energetics-based limitation to the maximal height
                  at which a species can occur. Quantifying the energetic costs
                  arising from heat stress represents an important challenge for
                  future investigations.},

                  the heat-shock (or stress) response, is activated when
                  environmental stress denatures proteins. Hsp synthesis is
                  activated at the upper temperatures of an organism's thermal
                  range and is therefore thought to be critical for enhancing
                  thermal tolerance limits in ectothermic animals. Here I show
                  that the two temperate sister species T. brunnea and T.
                  montereyi that occupy the subtidal and low-intertidal zone
                  differ from the low- to mid-intertidal T. funebralis (and the
                  subtropical mid-intertidal T. rugosa) in (i) heat tolerance,
                  (ii) the onset temperature of their main hsp, hsp70 (70 kDa),
                  (iii) the temperature of maximal hsp70 synthesis, (iv) the
                  upper temperature of hsp synthesis, and (v) the recovery from
                  a thermal stress typical for the mid-intertidal zone. A
                  regulatory model in which hsps themselves regulate their own
                  transcription and synthesis through a negative autoregulatory
                  feedback mechanism can explain acclimation-induced but not
                  interspecific variation in the onset temperature of hsp70
                  synthesis. Transplanting species across their vertical
                  distribution limits showed that interspecific differences in
                  the stress response are likely to prevent species occurring
                  lower from inhabiting sites higher in the rocky intertidal
                  zone. Endogenous levels of a hsp of a molecular mass of 72
                  kDa, hsp72, changed little with heat stress in a species'
                  native thermal environment. The results therefore confirm the
                  importance of interspecific differences in the stress response
                  for setting limits to an organism's thermal environment.
                  However, the role of hsps as short-term indicators of
                  sublethal heat stress within a species' native thermal
                  environment may be limited without a better understanding of
                  their functional and regulatory characteristics.},

                  temperature on biological rate processes. Here, we use
                  examples from our work on common killifish (Fundulus
                  heteroclitus) to illustrate some important conceptual issues
                  relating to TPCs in the context of using these curves to
                  predict the responses of organisms to climate change.
                  Phenotypic plasticity has the capacity to alter the shape and
                  position of the TPCs for acute exposures, but these changes
                  can be obscured when rate processes are measured only
                  following chronic exposures. For example, the acute TPC for
                  mitochondrial respiration in killifish is exponential in
                  shape, but this shape changes with acclimation. If respiration
                  rate is measured only at the acclimation temperature, the TPC
                  is linear, concealing the underlying mechanistic complexity at
                  an acute time scale. These issues are particularly problematic
                  when attempting to use TPCs to predict the responses of
                  organisms to temperature change in natural environments. Many
                  TPCs are generated using laboratory exposures to constant
                  temperatures, but temperature fluctuates in the natural
                  environment, and the mechanisms influencing performance at
                  acute and chronic time scales, and the responses of the
                  performance traits at these time scales may be quite
                  different. Unfortunately, our current understanding of the
                  mechanisms underlying the responses of organisms to
                  temperature change is incomplete, particularly with respect to
                  integrating from processes occurring at the level of single
                  proteins up to whole-organism functions across different time
                  scales, which is a challenge for the development of strongly
                  grounded mechanistic models of responses to global climate

                  their consequences for the species' survival and distribution
                  is an important problem in ecological physiology. This review
                  applies the concept of energy-limited tolerance to stress to
                  develop bioenergetic markers that can assist in integrating
                  the effects of multiple stressors and distinguishing between
                  the moderate stress compatible with long-term survival of
                  populations and bioenergetically unsustainable extreme stress.
                  These markers reflect the progressive decline of the aerobic
                  scope of an organism (defined as the fraction of the energy
                  flux and metabolic power supporting this flux available after
                  the basal maintenance costs of an organism are met) with
                  increasing levels of the environmental stress. During the
                  exposure to moderate stress (i.e., in the pejus range of the
                  environmental conditions), the aerobic scope is positive but
                  reduced compared with the optimum conditions. The reduction of
                  the metabolic scope can be due to the (1) elevated costs of
                  basal metabolism, (2) activation of the mechanisms for
                  protection and damage repair, (3) reduced assimilation of
                  food, and/or (4) stress-induced impacts on the aerobic
                  pathways producing ATP. This leads to suboptimal growth and
                  reproductive rates in the pejus range of environmental
                  conditions and is commonly observed in food-limited and
                  energy-limited wild populations. The tolerance windows of the
                  organisms are delimited by the pessimum range(s) of
                  environmental conditions in which the aerobic scope of the
                  organism disappears (so that all available energy and
                  metabolic capacity are used in support of basal metabolism),
                  energy resources are depleted, and partial anaerobiosis and/or
                  metabolic rate depression set in. The habitats where
                  environmental conditions remain in the pessimum zone long
                  enough to prevent consistent growth and reproduction often
                  coincide with the species' distributional limits. Thus, focus
                  on the bioenergetic effects of environmental stressors and
                  their immediate consequences for fitness provides a suitable
                  framework for integrating physiology and functional ecology
                  and can assist in understanding the driving forces and
                  limitations of environmental adaptation and improving
                  assessment of ecological risk as well as environmental
                  management in field populations facing multiple stressors.},

                  conservation. Despite increasing popularity, and ever-finer

                  recognized. Less understood are OA's consequences for

                  behaviourally mediated predator-prey interaction within the
                  rocky intertidal zone of the temperate eastern Pacific Ocean,
                  using it as a model system to explore OA's capacity to impair
                  invertebrate anti-predator behaviours more broadly. Our system
                  involves the iconic sea star predator, Pisaster ochraceus,
                  that elicits flee responses in numerous gastropod prey. We
                  examine, in particular, the capacity for OA-associated
                  reductions in pH to alter flight behaviours of the black
                  turban snail, Tegula funebralis, an often-abundant and
                  well-studied grazer in the system. We assess interactions
                  between these species at 16 discrete levels of pH, quantifying
                  the full functional response of Tegula under present and
                  near-future OA conditions. Results demonstrate the disruption
                  of snail anti-predator behaviours at low pH, with decreases in
                  the time individuals spend in refuge locations. We also show
                  that fluctuations in pH, including those typical of rock pools
                  inhabited by snails, do not materially change outcomes,
                  implying little capacity for episodically benign pH conditions
                  to aid behavioural recovery. Together, these findings suggest
                  a strong potential for OA to induce cascading community-level
                  shifts within this long-studied ecosystem.},

                  biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems will become increasingly
                  stressed by at least three independent factors. Rising
                  temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation will
                  cause substantial changes in the physical, chemical and
                  biological environment, which will then affect the ocean's
                  biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in ways that we are only
                  beginning to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect
                  organisms and biogeochemical cycles directly, but will also
                  increase upper ocean stratification. The changes in the
                  ocean's carbonate chemistry induced by the uptake of
                  anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO(2)) (i.e. ocean
                  acidification) will probably affect many organisms and
                  processes, although in ways that are currently not well
                  understood. Ocean deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved
                  oxygen (O(2)) from the ocean, is bound to occur in a warming
                  and more stratified ocean, causing stress to macro-organisms
                  that critically depend on sufficient levels of oxygen. These
                  three stressors-warming, acidification and deoxygenation-will
                  tend to operate globally, although with distinct regional
                  differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be
                  strongest in the high latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen
                  regions of the low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean
                  deoxygenation. Specific regions, such as the eastern boundary
                  upwelling systems, will be strongly affected by all three
                  stressors, making them potential hotspots for change. Of
                  additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean
                  acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude of the
                  organic matter exported to the ocean's interior, which then
                  might cause substantial changes in the oxygen concentration
                  there. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation are
                  essentially irreversible on centennial time scales, i.e. once
                  these changes have occurred, it will take centuries for the
                  ocean to recover. With the emission of CO(2) being the primary
                  driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation
                  strategy is to reduce these emissions.},

                  reproducibility. As respirometry datasets become increasingly
                  large and analytical approaches more complex, manipulating the

                  individuals to communities?to directional climate change or

                  models to data are not adequate for dealing with the immense
                  size of new datasets that are increasingly becoming available.
                  We require tools capable of tackling this issue in a simple,
                  reproducible and accessible way. We present a new,
                  reproducible pipeline in r that allows for relatively simple
                  fitting of 24 different TPC models using nonlinear least
                  squares (NLLS) regression. The pipeline consists of two
                  packages?rTPC and nls.multstart?that provide functions which
                  conveniently address common problems with NLLS fitting such as
                  the NLLS parameter starting values problem. rTPC also includes
                  functions to set starting values, estimate key TPC parameters

                  pipeline can be combined with other packages in r to robustly
                  and reproducibly fit multiple mathematical models to multiple
                  TPC datasets at once. In addition, we show how model selection
                  or averaging, weighted model fitting and bootstrapping can be
                  easily implemented within the pipeline. This new pipeline
                  provides a flexible and reproducible approach that makes the

                  temperature spanning 1280 km of coastline to test whether

                  growth and predation vulnerability of a critical foundation
                  species, the mussel Mytilus californianus. We find growth was

                  ectotherm's body temperature (Tb ) affects its performance or
                  fitness, are often used in an attempt to predict organismal
                  responses to climate change. Here, we examine the key - but
                  often biologically unreasonable - assumptions underlying this
                  approach; for example, that physiology and thermal regimes are
                  invariant over ontogeny, space and time, and also that TPCs
                  are independent of previously experienced Tb. We show how a
                  critical consideration of these assumptions can lead to
                  biologically useful hypotheses and experimental designs. For
                  example, rather than assuming that TPCs are fixed during
                  ontogeny, one can measure TPCs for each major life stage and
                  incorporate these into stage-specific ecological models to
                  reveal the life stage most likely to be vulnerable to climate
                  change. Our overall goal is to explicitly examine the
                  assumptions underlying the integration of TPCs with Tb , to
                  develop a framework within which empiricists can place their
                  work within these limitations, and to facilitate the
                  application of thermal physiology to understanding the

                  worldwide, and forecasting the ecological impacts of
                  acidification is a high priority for science, management, and
                  policy. As research on the topic expands at an exponential
                  rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in
                  organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is
                  necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform
                  the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing
                  the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to
                  ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival,
                  calcification, growth, development and abundance in response
                  to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is
                  pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses
                  varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some
                  predictable trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the
                  investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent
                  research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of
                  mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of
                  early life history stages is not universal across all
                  taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species'
                  responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification
                  in multi-species assemblages, suggesting that it is important
                  to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when
                  forecasting abundance patterns from single-species laboratory
                  experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other
                  factors, such as nutritional status or source population,
                  could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses.
                  Last, the results highlight a trend towards enhanced
                  sensitivity to acidification when taxa are concurrently
                  exposed to elevated seawater temperature.},

                  impacts of climate change will be mostly negative or positive
                  and how these changes will be geographically distributed.
                  These unknowns hamper the identification of regional winners
                  and losers, which can influence debate over climate policy.
                  Here, we use coral reefs to explore the spatial variability of
                  climate stress by modelling the ecological impacts of rising
                  sea temperatures and ocean acidification, two important coral
                  stressors associated with increasing greenhouse gas (GHG)
                  emissions. We then combine these results with national per
                  capita emissions to quantify inequities arising from the
                  distribution of cause (CO2 emissions) and effect (stress upon
                  reefs) among coral reef countries. We find pollution and coral
                  stress are spatially decoupled, creating substantial inequity
                  of impacts as a function of emissions. We then consider the
                  implications of such inequity for international climate
                  policy. Targets for GHG reductions are likely to be tied to a
                  country's emissions. Yet within a given level of GHG
                  emissions, our analysis reveals that some countries experience
                  relatively high levels of impact and will likely experience
                  greater financial cost in terms of lost ecosystem productivity
                  and more extensive adaptation measures. We suggest countries
                  so disadvantaged be given access to international adaptation
                  funds proportionate with impacts to their ecosystem. We raise
                  the idea that funds could be more equitably allocated by
                  formally including a metric of equity within a vulnerability
                  framework.},

                  anthropogenic influence and environmental change. The species
                  occupying these habitats are adapted to a world of extremes,
                  which may render them robust to the changing climate or more
                  vulnerable if they are at their physiological limits. We
                  characterized the diurnal, seasonal and interannual patterns
                  of flux in biogeochemistry across an intertidal gradient on a
                  temperate sandstone platform in eastern Australia over 6 years

                  understanding of this habitat in context with global change.
                  We used rock pools as natural mesocosms to determine
                  biogeochemistry dynamics and patterns of eco-stress
                  experienced by resident biota. In situ measurements and
                  discrete water samples were collected night and day during
                  neap low tide events to capture diurnal biogeochemistry
                  cycles. Calculation of pHT using total alkalinity (TA) and
                  dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) revealed that the
                  mid-intertidal habitat exhibited the greatest flux over the
                  years (pHT 7.52-8.87), and over a single tidal cycle (1.11 pHT
                  units), while the low-intertidal (pHT 7.82-8.30) and subtidal
                  (pHT 7.87-8.30) were less variable. Temperature flux was also
                  greatest in the mid-intertidal (8.0-34.5°C) and over a single
                  tidal event (14°C range), as typical of temperate rocky
                  shores. Mean TA and DIC increased at night and decreased
                  during the day, with the most extreme conditions measured in
                  the mid-intertidal owing to prolonged emersion periods.
                  Temporal sampling revealed that net ecosystem calcification
                  and production were highest during the day and lowest at

                  these interactions remain one of the largest uncertainties in

                  uncertainty by performing a meta-analysis of 112 published
                  factorial experiments that evaluated the impacts of multiple
                  stressors on animal mortality in freshwater, marine and
                  terrestrial communities. We found that, on average,
                  mortalities from the combined action of two stressors were not
                  synergistic and this result was consistent across studies
                  investigating different stressors, study organisms and
                  life-history stages. Furthermore, only one-third of relevant
                  experiments displayed truly synergistic effects, which does
                  not support the prevailing ecological paradigm that synergies
                  are rampant. However, in more than three-quarters of relevant
                  experiments, the outcome of multiple stressor interactions was
                  non-additive (i.e. synergies or antagonisms), suggesting that

                  modern mammals and birds. The most widely accepted explanation
                  for the evolution of endothermy has been selection for
                  enhanced aerobic capacity. We review this hypothesis in the
                  light of advances in our understanding of ATP generation by
                  mitochondria and muscle performance. Together with the
                  development of isotope-based techniques for the measurement of
                  metabolic rate in free-ranging vertebrates these have
                  confirmed the importance of aerobic scope in the evolution of
                  endothermy: absolute aerobic scope, ATP generation by
                  mitochondria and muscle power output are all strongly
                  temperature-dependent, indicating that there would have been
                  significant improvement in whole-organism locomotor ability
                  with a warmer body. New data on mitochondrial ATP generation
                  and proton leak suggest that the thermal physiology of
                  mitochondria may differ between organisms of contrasting
                  ecology and thermal flexibility. Together with recent
                  biophysical modelling, this strengthens the long-held view
                  that endothermy originated in smaller, active eurythermal
                  ectotherms living in a cool but variable thermal environment.
                  We propose that rather than being a secondary consequence of
                  the evolution of an enhanced aerobic scope, a warmer body was
                  the means by which that enhanced aerobic scope was achieved.
                  This modified hypothesis requires that the rise in metabolic
                  rate and the insulation necessary to retain metabolic heat
                  arose early in the lineages leading to birds and mammals.
                  Large dinosaurs were warm, but were not endotherms, and the
                  metabolic status of pterosaurs remains unresolved.},

                  is sufficient to allow population persistence via evolutionary
                  adaptation has seldom been quantified. To ask whether rapid
                  adaptation in reef-building corals can keep pace with future
                  ocean warming, we measured genetic variation at predicted
                  warm-adapted loci and simulated future evolution and
                  persistence in a high-latitude population of corals from
                  Rarotonga, Cook Islands. Alleles associated with thermal
                  tolerance were present but at low frequencies in this cooler,
                  southerly locality. Simulations based on predicted ocean
                  warming in Rarotonga showed rapid evolution of heat tolerance
                  resulting in population persistence under mild warming
                  scenarios consistent with low CO2 emission plans, RCP2.6 and
                  RCP4.5. Under more severe scenarios, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5,
                  adaptation was not rapid enough to prevent extinction.
                  Population adaptation was faster for models based on smaller
                  numbers of additive loci that determine thermal tolerance and
                  for higher population growth rates. Finally, accelerated
                  migration via transplantation of thermally tolerant
                  individuals (1 to 5\%/year) sped adaptation. These results
                  show that cool-water corals can adapt to warmer oceans but
                  only under mild scenarios resulting from international
                  emissions controls. Incorporation of genomic data into models

                  Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol

                  increased for all boundaries earlier identified as

                  concentrations would force intensification of
                  upwelling-favorable winds in eastern boundary current systems
                  that contribute substantial services to society. Because there
                  is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind
                  trends support Bakun's hypothesis, we performed a
                  meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind
                  intensification. The preponderance of published analyses
                  suggests that winds have intensified in the California,
                  Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the
                  Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind
                  change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger
                  intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes,
                  consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate
                  change. Overall, reported changes in coastal winds, although
                  subtle and spatially variable, support Bakun's hypothesis of

                  is making the oceans more acidic, thereby reducing their
                  degree of saturation with respect to calcium carbonate
                  (CaCO3). There is mounting concern over the impact that future
                  CO2-induced reductions in the CaCO3 saturation state of
                  seawater will have on marine organisms that construct their
                  shells and skeletons from this mineral. Here, we present the
                  results of 60 d laboratory experiments in which we
                  investigated the effects of CO2-induced ocean acidification on
                  calcification in 18 benthic marine organisms. Species were
                  selected to span a broad taxonomic range (crustacea, cnidaria,
                  echinoidea, rhodophyta, chlorophyta, gastropoda, bivalvia,
                  annelida) and included organisms producing aragonite, low-Mg
                  calcite, and high-Mg calcite forms of CaCO3. We show that 10
                  of the 18 species studied exhibited reduced rates of net
                  calcification and, in some cases, net dissolution under
                  elevated p CO2. However, in seven species, net calcification
                  increased under the intermediate and/or highest levels of p
                  CO2, and one species showed no response at all. These varied
                  responses may reflect differences amongst organisms in their
                  ability to regulate pH at the site of calcification, in the
                  extent to which their outer shell layer is protected by an
                  organic covering, in the solubility of their shell or skeletal
                  mineral, and in the extent to which they utilize
                  photosynthesis. Whatever the specific mechanism(s) involved,
                  our results suggest that the impact of elevated atmospheric p
                  CO2 on marine calcification is more varied than previously

                  recognize intuitively that these environmental changes are
                  translated into community changes via organismal physiology.
                  However, physiology remains a black box in many ecological
                  studies, and coexisting species in a community are often
                  assumed to respond similarly to environmental stressors. Here,
                  we emphasize how greater attention to physiology can improve
                  our ability to predict the emergent effects of ocean change.
                  In particular, understanding shifts in the intensity and
                  outcome of species interactions such as competition and

                  vulnerability to a changing environment. For example,
                  environmental stressors may affect a particular species by
                  driving that organism outside a tolerance window, by altering
                  the costs of metabolic processes under the new conditions, or

                  driver (e.g., temperature and ocean acidification) will be

                  calcium carbonate saturation states, which impacts
                  shell-forming marine organisms from plankton to benthic
                  molluscs, echinoderms, and corals. Many calcifying species
                  exhibit reduced calcification and growth rates in laboratory
                  experiments under high-CO2 conditions. Ocean acidification
                  also causes an increase in carbon fixation rates in some
                  photosynthetic organisms (both calcifying and noncalcifying).
                  The potential for marine organisms to adapt to increasing CO2
                  and broader implications for ocean ecosystems are not well
                  known; both are high priorities for future research. Although
                  ocean pH has varied in the geological past, paleo-events may
                  be only imperfect analogs to current conditions.},

                  developing causal, mechanistic explanations of shifts in
                  biogeographic patterning occurring in concert with global
                  change. These analyses can identify the cellular loci and
                  intensities of stress-induced perturbation and generate
                  predictions about ecosystem alterations in a changing world.
                  Congeneric species adapted to different abiotic conditions
                  offer excellent study systems for these purposes. Several
                  findings have emerged from such comparative studies: 1) In
                  aquatic and terrestrial habitats, the most heat-tolerant
                  ectotherms may be most threatened by further increases in
                  temperature, due to proximity of these species' thermal optima
                  and tolerance limits to current maximal ambient temperatures
                  and limited capacities for acclimatization to higher
                  temperatures. 2) Cardiac function is a "weak link" in acute
                  thermal tolerance. 3) Stress-induced changes in gene
                  expression comprise a graded response involving genes linked
                  to damage repair, lysis of irreversibly damaged molecules, and
                  downregulation of cell proliferation. Transcriptomic and
                  proteomic analyses provide "biomarkers" for diagnosing degrees
                  of stress. 4) Different abiotic stresses may have synergistic
                  or opposing effects on gene expression, a complexity needing
                  consideration when developing integrated pictures of effects
                  of global change. 5) Adaptation of proteins can result from
                  one to a few amino acid substitutions, which can occur at many
                  sites in a protein, a discovery with implications for rates of
                  adaptive evolution. 6) Greater thermal tolerance of invasive
                  species may favor their replacement of natives. 7) Losses of
                  protein-coding genes and temperature-responsive gene
                  regulatory abilities in stenothermal ectotherms of the
                  Southern Ocean may lead to broad extinctions.},

                  closest to their upper thermal tolerance limits, which
                  physiological systems set these limits, and how species differ
                  in acclimatization capacities for modifying their thermal
                  tolerances. Reductionist studies at the molecular level can
                  contribute to this analysis by revealing how much change in
                  sequence is needed to adapt proteins to warmer
                  temperatures--thus providing insights into potential rates of
                  adaptive evolution--and determining how the contents of
                  genomes--protein-coding genes and gene regulatory
                  mechanisms--influence capacities for adapting to acute and
                  long-term increases in temperature. Studies of congeneric
                  invertebrates from thermally stressful rocky intertidal
                  habitats have shown that warm-adapted congeners are most
                  susceptible to local extinctions because their acute upper
                  thermal limits (LT(50) values) lie near current thermal maxima
                  and their abilities to increase thermal tolerance through
                  acclimation are limited. Collapse of cardiac function may
                  underlie acute and longer-term thermal limits. Local
                  extinctions from heat death may be offset by in-migration of
                  genetically warm-adapted conspecifics from mid-latitude 'hot
                  spots', where midday low tides in summer select for heat
                  tolerance. A single amino acid replacement is sufficient to
                  adapt a protein to a new thermal range. More challenging to
                  adaptive evolution are lesions in genomes of stenotherms like
                  Antarctic marine ectotherms, which have lost protein-coding
                  genes and gene regulatory mechanisms needed for coping with
                  rising temperature. These extreme stenotherms, along with
                  warm-adapted eurytherms living near their thermal limits, may
                  be the major 'losers' from climate change.},

                  tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained
                  climate-induced effects of rising temperatures on species
                  abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the
                  resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary
                  link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning
                  at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in
                  water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of
                  performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress,
                  caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen
                  supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope.
                  Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance
                  and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like
                  hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of
                  protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal
                  extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or
                  adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal
                  windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on
                  a limited temperature range results from temperature-dependent
                  trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular
                  structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support
                  maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors
                  like CO(2) (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with
                  these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests
                  that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting
                  passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also
                  exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal
                  performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to
                  the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual
                  analysis suggests that the relationships between energy
                  turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and
                  the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative
                  understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal
                  matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors
                  involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to
                  climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus,
                  community responses at the ecosystem level.},

                  spatial variation in body temperature, and
                  biochemical/physiological variation among individuals, affect
                  the prediction of organisms' performance in nature. For
                  'normal' body temperatures - benign temperatures near the
                  species' mean - thermal biology traditionally uses performance
                  curves to describe how physiological capabilities vary with
                  temperature. However, these curves, which are typically
                  measured under static laboratory conditions, can yield
                  incomplete or inaccurate predictions of how organisms respond
                  to natural patterns of temperature variation. For example,
                  scale transition theory predicts that, in a variable
                  environment, peak average performance is lower and occurs at a
                  lower mean temperature than the peak of statically measured
                  performance. We also demonstrate that temporal variation in
                  performance is minimized near this new 'optimal' temperature.
                  These factors add complexity to predictions of the
                  consequences of climate change. We then move beyond the
                  performance curve approach to consider the effects of rare,
                  extreme temperatures. A statistical procedure (the
                  environmental bootstrap) allows for long-term simulations that
                  capture the temporal pattern of extremes (a Poisson interval
                  distribution), which is characterized by clusters of events
                  interspersed with long intervals of benign conditions. The
                  bootstrap can be combined with biophysical models to
                  incorporate temporal, spatial and physiological variation into
                  evolutionary models of thermal tolerance. We conclude with
                  several challenges that must be overcome to more fully develop
                  our understanding of thermal performance in the context of a
                  changing climate by explicitly considering different forms of
                  small-scale variation. These challenges highlight the need to
                  empirically and rigorously test existing theories.},

                  processes such as aerobic metabolism, environmental
                  temperature plays an important role in shaping the
                  distribution and abundance of species. As temperature
                  increases, the rate of metabolism increases and then rapidly
                  declines at higher temperatures - a response that can be
                  described using a thermal performance curve (TPC). Although
                  the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is often
                  attributed to the competing effects of thermodynamics, which
                  can be described using the Arrhenius equation, and the effects
                  of temperature on protein stability, this account represents
                  an over-simplification of the factors acting even at the level
                  of single proteins. In addition, it cannot adequately account
                  for the effects of temperature on complex multistep processes,
                  such as aerobic metabolism, that rely on mechanisms acting
                  across multiple levels of biological organization. The purpose
                  of this review is to explore our current understanding of the
                  factors that shape the TPC for aerobic metabolism in response
                  to acute changes in temperature, and to highlight areas where
                  this understanding is weak or insufficient. Developing a more
                  strongly grounded mechanistic model to account for the shape
                  of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is crucial because these
                  TPCs are the foundation of several recent attempts to predict
                  the responses of species to climate change, including the
                  metabolic theory of ecology and the hypothesis of oxygen and

  abstract     = {Observations of climate impacts on ecosystems highlight the
                  need for an understanding of organismal thermal ranges and
                  their implications at the ecosystem level. Where changes in
                  aquatic animal populations have been observed, the integrative
                  concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance
                  (OCLTT) has successfully characterised the onset of thermal
                  limits to performance and field abundance. The OCLTT concept
                  addresses the molecular to whole-animal mechanisms that define
                  thermal constraints on the capacity for oxygen supply to the
                  organism in relation to oxygen demand. The resulting 'total
                  excess aerobic power budget' supports an animal's performance
                  (e.g. comprising motor activity, reproduction and growth)
                  within an individual's thermal range. The aerobic power budget
                  is often approximated through measurements of aerobic scope
                  for activity (i.e. the maximum difference between resting and
                  the highest exercise-induced rate of oxygen consumption),
                  whereas most animals in the field rely on lower (i.e. routine)
                  modes of activity. At thermal limits, OCLTT also integrates
                  protective mechanisms that extend time-limited tolerance to
                  temperature extremes - mechanisms such as chaperones,
                  anaerobic metabolism and antioxidative defence. Here, we
                  briefly summarise the OCLTT concept and update it by
                  addressing the role of routine metabolism. We highlight
                  potential pitfalls in applying the concept and discuss the
                  variables measured that led to the development of OCLTT. We
                  propose that OCLTT explains why thermal vulnerability is
                  highest at the whole-animal level and lowest at the molecular
                  level. We also discuss how OCLTT captures the thermal
                  constraints on the evolution of aquatic animal life and
                  supports an understanding of the benefits of transitioning
                  from water to land.},

                  metabolic rate, and the additional factor of pH is a major
                  driver at the biochemical level. These three factors have
                  frequently been found to interact, complicating the
                  formulation of broad models predicting metabolic rates and
                  hence ecological functioning. In this first study of the
                  effects of warming and ocean acidification, and their
                  potential interaction, on metabolic rate across a broad range
                  in body size (two to three orders of magnitude difference in
                  body mass), we addressed the impact of climate change on the
                  sea urchin ITALIC! Heliocidaris erythrogrammain context with
                  climate projections for southeast Australia, an ocean warming
                  hotspot. Urchins were gradually introduced to two temperatures
                  (18 and 23°C) and two pH levels (7.5 and 8.0), at which they
                  were maintained for 2 months. Identical experimental trials
                  separated by several weeks validated the fact that a new
                  physiological steady state had been reached, otherwise known
                  as acclimation. The relationship between body size,
                  temperature and acidification on the metabolic rate of ITALIC!
                  H. erythrogrammawas strikingly stable. Both stressors caused
                  increases in metabolic rate: 20\% for temperature and 19\% for
                  pH. Combined effects were additive: a 44\% increase in
                  metabolism. Body size had a highly stable relationship with
                  metabolic rate regardless of temperature or pH. None of these
                  diverse drivers of metabolism interacted or modulated the
                  effects of the others, highlighting the partitioned nature of
                  how each influences metabolic rate, and the importance of
                  achieving a full acclimation state. Despite these increases in
                  energetic demand there was very limited capacity for
                  compensatory modulating of feeding rate; food consumption
                  increased only in the very smallest specimens, and only in
                  response to temperature, and not pH. Our data show that
                  warming, acidification and body size all substantially affect
                  metabolism and are highly consistent and partitioned in their
                  effects, and for ITALIC! H. erythrogramma, near-future climate
                  change will incur a substantial energetic cost.},

                  (≈1000 μatm) would result in a maximum drop in arterial

                  compared the heat-shock responses of four species of marine
                  snails of the genus Tegula that occupy thermal niches
                  differing in absolute temperature and range of temperature. We
                  examined the effects of short-term heat stress and thermal
                  acclimation on the synthesis of hsps of size classes 90, 77,

                  hsp synthesis (T(peak)) and temperatures at which hsp
                  synthesis was heat-inactivated (T(off)) were lowest in two
                  low-intertidal to subtidal species from the temperate zone, T.

                  of protein by T. brunnea and T. montereyi was heat-inactivated
                  at temperatures commonly encountered by T. funebralis during
                  low tides on warm days. In turn, protein synthesis by T.
                  funebralis was blocked at the upper temperatures of the
                  habitat of T. rugosa. Acclimation of snails to 13 degrees C,
                  18 degrees C and 23 degrees C shifted T(on) and T(peak) for
                  certain hsps, but did not affect T(off). The heat-shock
                  responses of field-acclimatized snails were generally reduced

  abstract     = {In our previous studies of heat-shock protein (hsp) expression
                  in congeneric marine gastropods of the genus Tegula, we
                  observed interspecific and acclimation-induced variation in
                  the temperatures at which heat-shock gene expression is
                  induced (T(on)). To investigate the factors responsible for
                  these inter- and intraspecific differences in T(on), we tested
                  the predictions of the 'cellular thermometer' model for the
                  transcriptional regulation of hsp expression. According to
                  this model, hsps not active in chaperoning unfolded proteins
                  bind to a transcription factor, heat-shock factor-1 (HSF1),
                  thereby reducing the levels of free HSF1 that are available to
                  bind to the heat-shock element, a regulatory element upstream
                  of hsp genes. Under stress, hsps bind to denatured proteins,
                  releasing HSF1, which can now activate hsp gene transcription.
                  Thus, elevated levels of heat-shock proteins of the 40, 70 and
                  90 kDa families (hsp 40, hsp70 and hsp90, respectively) would
                  be predicted to elevate T(on). Conversely, elevated levels of
                  HSF1 would be predicted to decrease T(on). Following
                  laboratory acclimation to 13, 18 and 23 degrees C, we used
                  solid-phase immunochemistry (western analysis) to quantify
                  endogenous levels of two hsp70 isoforms (hsp74 and hsp72),
                  hsp90 and HSF1 in the low- to mid-intertidal species Tegula
                  funebralis and in two subtidal to low-intertidal congeners, T.
                  brunnea and T. montereyi. We found higher endogenous levels of
                  hsp72 (a strongly heat-induced isoform) at 13 and 18 degrees C
                  in T. funebralis in comparison with T. brunnea and T.
                  montereyi. However, T. funebralis also had higher levels of
                  HSF1 than its congeners. The higher levels of HSF1 in T.
                  funebralis cannot, within the framework of the cellular
                  thermometer model, account for the higher T(on) observed for

                  to explain the cause of the increases in T(on) that occurred
                  during warm acclimation of the two subtidal species, in which
                  warm acclimation was accompanied by increased levels of hsp72,
                  hsp74 and hsp90, whereas levels of HSF1 remained stable. T.
                  funebralis, which experiences greater heat stress than its
                  subtidal congeners, consistently had higher ratios of hsp72 to
                  hsp74 than its congeners, although the sum of levels of the
                  two isoforms was similar for all three species except at the
                  highest acclimation temperature (23 degrees C). The ratio of
                  hsp72 to hsp74 may provide a more accurate estimate of
                  environmental heat stress than the total concentrations of
                  both hsp70 isoforms.},

  abstract     = {Coral reefs, one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world,
                  face increasing pressures from global and local anthropogenic
                  stressors. Therefore, a better understanding of the ecological
                  ramifications of warming and land-based inputs (e.g.
                  sedimentation and nutrient loading) on coral reef ecosystems
                  is necessary. In this study, we measured how a natural
                  nutrient and sedimentation gradient affected multiple facets
                  of coral functionality, including endosymbiont and coral host
                  response variables, holobiont metabolic responses and percent
                  cover of Pocillopora acuta colonies in Mo'orea, French
                  Polynesia. We used thermal performance curves to quantify the
                  relationship between metabolic rates and temperature along the
                  environmental gradient. We found that algal endosymbiont
                  percent nitrogen content, endosymbiont densities and total
                  chlorophyll a content increased with nutrient input, while
                  endosymbiont nitrogen content per cell decreased, likely
                  representing competition among the algal endosymbionts.
                  Nutrient and sediment loading decreased coral metabolic
                  responses to thermal stress in terms of their thermal
                  performance and metabolic rate processes. The acute thermal
                  optimum for dark respiration decreased, along with the maximal
                  performance for gross photosynthetic and calcification rates.
                  Gross photosynthetic and calcification rates normalized to a
                  reference temperature (26.8 °C) decreased along the gradient.
                  Lastly, percent cover of P. acuta colonies decreased by nearly
                  two orders of magnitude along the nutrient gradient. These
                  findings illustrate that nutrient and sediment loading affect
                  multiple levels of coral functionality. Understanding how
                  local-scale anthropogenic stressors influence the responses of
                  corals to temperature can inform coral reef management,
                  particularly in relation to the mediation of land-based inputs
                  into coastal coral reef ecosystems.},

                  contributing to the view that climate change effects are
                  important but difficult to characterize generally. However,
                  systematic variation in metabolic effects of temperature
                  across trophic levels suggests that warming may lead to
                  predictable shifts in food web structure and productivity. We
                  experimentally tested the effects of warming on food web
                  structure and productivity under two resource supply
                  scenarios. Consistent with predictions based on universal
                  metabolic responses to temperature, we found that warming
                  strengthened consumer control of primary production when
                  resources were augmented. Warming shifted food web structure
                  and reduced total biomass despite increases in primary
                  productivity in a marine food web. In contrast, at lower
                  resource levels, food web production was constrained at all
                  temperatures. These results demonstrate that small temperature
                  changes could dramatically shift food web dynamics and provide
                  a general, species-independent mechanism for ecological
                  response to environmental temperature change.},

  abstract     = {Ocean acidification (OA) is occurring across a backdrop of
                  concurrent environmental changes that may in turn influence
                  species' responses to OA. Temperature affects many fundamental
                  biological processes and governs key reactions in the seawater
                  carbonate system. It therefore has the potential to offset or
                  exacerbate the effects of OA. While initial studies have
                  examined the combined impacts of warming and OA for a narrow
                  range of climate change scenarios, our mechanistic
                  understanding of the interactive effects of temperature and OA
                  remains limited. Here, we use the blue mussel, Mytilus
                  galloprovincialis, as a model species to test how OA affects
                  the growth of a calcifying invertebrate across a wide range of
                  temperatures encompassing their thermal optimum. Mussels were
                  exposed in the laboratory to a factorial combination of low
                  and high pCO2 (400 and 1200 µatm CO2) and temperatures (12,
                  14, 16, 18, 20, and 24°C) for one month. Results indicate that
                  the effects of OA on shell growth are highly dependent on
                  temperature. Although high CO2 significantly reduced mussel
                  growth at 14°C, this effect gradually lessened with successive
                  warming to 20°C, illustrating how moderate warming can mediate
                  the effects of OA through temperature's effects on both
                  physiology and seawater geochemistry. Furthermore, the mussels
                  grew thicker shells in warmer conditions independent of CO2
                  treatment. Together, these results highlight the importance of
                  considering the physiological and geochemical interactions
                  between temperature and carbonate chemistry when interpreting
                  species' vulnerability to OA.},

  abstract     = {A simple food chain model of community structure was used to
                  evaluate the roles of bottom-up and top-down factors in a
                  rocky intertidal community. Predictions of the model were
                  modified to incorporate known variation in the strength of
                  species inter- actions and nutrient delivery rates along a
                  wave-exposure gradient. To test the predictions of the model,
                  I manipulated nutrients and consumers in tide pools chiseled
                  into mudstone benches at two sites that varied in degree of
                  wave exposure. The pools were located in the mid-intertidal
                  zone between ;1 and 1.5 m above mean lower low water (MLLW),
                  at Boiler Bay, Oregon, USA. The focal organisms were the
                  benthic macroalgae and mobile inver- tebrate herbivores that
                  dominate naturally occurring tide pools at this site. I
                  manipulated nutrient levels and the abundance of herbivores in
                  these tide pools in a fully factorial randomized block design
                  replicated six times at a wave-exposed and a wave- protected
                  site. The experiment was maintained for two years (1994-1996).
                  The abundances of herbivores and macroalgae were monitored in
                  the spring, summer, and fall of each year. I measured primary
                  productivity in the tide pools during the summer. Herbivores
                  had a negative impact on algal abundance. The total effect of
                  herbivory, and the efficiency of herbivores per se, on algal
                  abundance was lower at the wave-exposed site. Nutrient
                  additions had a positive effect on algal abundance, but this
                  effect was reduced at the wave-exposed site. Nutrients also
                  appeared to increase algal productivity, but only where
                  herbivore abundance was low. Algal abundance patterns were
                  generally consistent with model predictions for bottom-up,
                  top-down, and hydrodynamic effects. In contrast to model
                  predictions, herbivore abundance did not respond to the
                  nutrient treatment. The decoupling of consumers from resource
                  dynamics is interpreted to be the result of an herbivore
                  preference for noncalcified seaweeds with higher potential
                  growth rates. In wave-protected pools, where nutrients were
                  most limiting and consumers were most effi- cient, seaweeds
                  with the potential to translate elevated nutrient levels into
                  growth had no effective refuge from consumers. The difference
                  in scale between resource patches (tide pools) and the
                  foraging range of the dominant herbivore, Tegula funebralis,
                  may have augmented the ability of this herbivore to virtually
                  exclude fleshy seaweeds from wave- protected pools. Expanding
                  the domain of applicability of food chain models requires the
                  incorporation of consumer preferences, variation in plant
                  growth rates, environmental gra- dients, and differences in
                  the relative scales of resource patches and foraging ranges of
                  consumers.},

  abstract     = {We explicitly quantified spatial and temporal patterns in the
                  body temperature of an ecologically important species of
                  intertidal invertebrate, the mussel Mytilus californianus,
                  along the majority of its latitudinal range from Washington to
                  southern California, USA. Using long-term (five years),
                  high-frequency temperature records recorded at multiple sites,
                  we tested the hypothesis that local ''modifying factors'' such
                  as the timing of low tide in summer can lead to large-scale
                  geographic mosaics of body temperature. Our results show that
                  patterns of body temperature during aerial exposure at low
                  tide vary in physiologically meaningful and often
                  counterintuitive ways over large sections of this species'
                  geographic range. We evaluated the spatial correlations among
                  sites to explore how body temperatures change along the
                  latitudinal gradient, and these analyses show that ''hot
                  spots'' and ''cold spots'' exist where temperatures are hotter
                  or colder than expected based on latitude. We identified four
                  major hot spots and four cold spots along the entire
                  geographic gradient with at least one hot spot and one cold
                  spot in each of the three regions examined (Washington-
                  Oregon, Central California, and Southern California). Temporal
                  autocorrelation analysis of year-to-year consistency and
                  temporal predictability in the mussel body temperatures
                  revealed that southern animals experience higher levels of
                  predictability in thermal signals than northern animals. We
                  also explored the role of wave splash at a subset of sites and
                  found that, while average daily temperature extremes varied
                  between sites with different levels of wave splash, yearly
                  extreme temperatures were often similar, as were patterns of
                  predictability. Our results suggest that regional patterns of
                  tidal regime and local pattern of wave splash can overwhelm
                  those of large-scale climate in driving patterns of body
                  temperature, leading to complex thermal mosaics of temperature
                  rather than simple latitudinal gradients. A narrow focus on
                  population changes only at range margins may overlook
                  climatically forced local extinctions and other population
                  changes at sites well within a species range. Our results
                  emphasize the importance of quantitatively examining
                  biogeographic patterns in environ- mental variables at scales
                  relevant to organisms, and in forecasting the impacts of
                  changes in climate across species ranges.},

  abstract     = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of
                  physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of
                  individual organisms to the ecology of populations,
                  communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which
                  organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials,
                  is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a
                  quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body
                  size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic
                  rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the
                  environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and
                  reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of
                  organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples
                  include: (1) life history attributes, including devel- opment
                  rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and
                  population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including
                  carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and
                  patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes,
                  including rates of biomass production and respiration and
                  patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the
                  ecological literature strongly support the theoretical
                  predictions. Even- tually, metabolic theory may provide a
                  conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic
                  theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

                  of seawater, is emerging as a key environmental challenge
                  accompanying global warming and other human-induced
                  perturbations. Considerable research seeks to define the scope
                  and character of potential outcomes from this phenomenon, but
                  a crucial impediment persists. Ecological theory, despite its
                  power and utility, has been only peripherally applied to the
                  problem. Here we sketch in broad strokes several areas where
                  fundamental principles of ecology have the capacity to
                  generate insight into ocean acidification's consequences. We
                  focus on conceptual models that, when considered in the
                  context of acidification, yield explicit predictions regarding
                  a spectrum of population- and community-level effects, from
                  narrowing of species ranges and shifts in patterns of
                  demographic connectivity, to modified consumer-resource
                  relationships, to ascendance of weedy taxa and loss of species
                  diversity. Although our coverage represents only a small
                  fraction of the breadth of possible insights achievable from
                  the application of theory, our hope is that this initial foray
                  will spur expanded efforts to blend experiments with
                  theoretical approaches. The result promises to be a deeper and
                  more nuanced understanding of ocean acidification'and the

  abstract     = {Although previous studies have demonstrated that heat-shock
                  protein 70 (Hsp70) can be induced by environmental stress,
                  little is known about natural variation in this response over
                  short time scales. We examined how Hsp70 levels varied over
                  days to weeks in two intertidal snail species of the genus
                  Tegula: Sampling was conducted both under naturally changing
                  environmental conditions and in different vertical zones on a
                  rocky shore. The subtidal to low-intertidal T. brunnea was
                  transplanted into shaded and unshaded mid-intertidal cages to
                  assess temporal variation in Hsps under conditions of
                  increased stress. For comparison, the low to mid-intertidal T.
                  funebralis was transplanted into mid-intertidal cages, within
                  this species' natural zone of occurrence. Snails were sampled
                  every 3 to 4 days for one month, and endogenous levels of two
                  Hsp70-kDa family members (Hsp72 and Hsp74) were quantified
                  using solid-phase immunochemistry. Following periods of midday
                  low tides, levels of Hsps increased greatly in transplanted T.
                  brunnea but not in T. funebralis. Levels of Hsps increased
                  less in T. brunnea transplanted to shaded cages than to
                  unshaded cages, suggesting that prolonged emersion and
                  reduction in feeding time per se are factors that are only
                  mildly stressful. Upregulated levels of Hsps returned to base
                  levels within days. In unmanipulated snails collected from
                  their natural zones, Hsp levels showed little change with
                  thermal variation, indicating that these species did not
                  experience thermally stressful conditions during this study.
                  However, under common conditions in the mid-intertidal zone,
                  Hsp70 levels reflected the different thermal sensitivities of
                  the physiological systems of these two species.},

                  broad overlap with it in the rocky intertidal zone at Mukkaw
                  Bay, Washington. Observations on Tegula over a 5—yr period
                  indicate that it settles high intertidally, lives there for
                  5—6 yr, and then tends to migrate lower into contact with
                  Pisaster. Tegula lays down an annual growth line permitting it
                  to be aged and a growth curve constructed. Analysis of
                  relative growth and reproduction indicates that beyond a
                  certain size (16 mm) large individuals perform less well in
                  the upper than those in the lower intertidal zone. Pisaster
                  consumes 25—28\% of the adult Tegula per year in the area of
                  spatial overlap, based on analysis of the age structure of
                  6—17 yr old Tegula, and by direct estimates of the percentage
                  of the standing crop consumed annually. The relationship
                  between Pisaster and sex ratio, relative energy limitation and
                  reproductive output (fitness) of Tegula is discussed for three
                  subpopulations. It is suggested that the implied results of
                  the interaction is typical of that between a major predator
                  and one of its less preferred prey. The prominent zonation
                  exhibited by preferred prey, the observed intimacy of
                  association of predator and less preferred prey, and the
                  zoogeographic homogeneity of the Pacific rocky coastline
                  community are discussed in relation to three intermeshing

  abstract     = {The mid—zone rocky intertidal community at protected and
                  semiprotected areas in New England is characterized by a few,
                  relatively small—bodied herbivore species. The effects of
                  gastropod herbivores, primarily Littorina littorea, on
                  secondary succession in the community were experimentally
                  investigated. These periwinkle snails preferentially consume
                  early successional, ephemeral algae such as Ulva lactuca L.,
                  Enteromorpha spp., and Porphyra spp. If not grazed, these
                  early stages inhibit the appearance of a later successional
                  species, Fucus vesiculous L. The effect of the herbivores on
                  succession is to speed up the early successional sequence by
                  releasing Fucus from inhibition by ephemeral species. Although
                  these herbivores effectively control the ephemeral algae, they
                  are usually unable to regulate the establishment of Fuchs. The
                  periwinkles will readily graze small Fucus germlings (<3—5 cm
                  long), and can prevent their successful establishment on
                  smooth rock surfaces. However, substratum microtopography
                  created by small crevices or pits or barnacles provides
                  spatial refuges for small germlings. These plants quickly grow
                  to a size at which they are less susceptible to periwinkle
                  grazing. Thus although Fucus has a grazer—vulnerable stage, it
                  often escapes herbivore control by virtue of spatial and
                  size—related refuges. These escapes are herbivore—density
                  dependent, however; unusually high number of perwinkles can
                  prevent Fucus establishment, even when spatial refuges occur.
                  Although the periwinkles harm young Fucus, they benefit older
                  Fucus plants by grazing epiphytes from the blades, in lieu of
                  the plant itself. The grazers thereby increase the persistence
                  of individual Fucus and stabilize the community that depends
                  upon Fucus for a habitat. The perwinkles thus play a subtle
                  but important role in the community.},

  abstract     = {Intertidal grazing molluscs show striking local and geographic
                  variation in distribution and body size. Their density is
                  generally greatest in the upper and mid-intertidal zones on
                  rocky shores of the Pacific coast of North America, and least
                  in the low intertidal zone. However, the elevation of the
                  lower limits of their shore-level distribution varies
                  considerably among sites. In addition, the lower limits are
                  generally higher south of central California than in the
                  north, and the average body size is usually smaller in the
                  south than farther north. This is exemplified by the commonest
                  molluscan grazer in the mid-intertidal region of many rocky
                  shores on this coast, the trochid snail Tegula funebralis. A
                  hypothesis to explain these patterns, that they are due to
                  variation in predation, was tested. At sites where predator
                  density was high, regardless of latitude, the lower limit of
                  Tegula's intertidal range was higher on the shore, compared
                  with areas containing few predators. Shell width was usually
                  smaller, and increased with elevation wherever predators were
                  abundant. Predators were more abun- dant at southern than at
                  northern sites. The primary predators of Tegula are octopuses
                  (Octopus bimaculoides and 0. bimaculatus), the starfish
                  Pisaster ochraceus, and crabs of the genus Cancer. The
                  octopuses occur only at the southern sites, whereas Pisaster
                  and Cancer are found throughout the geographic range of the
                  study. Reciprocal transplants of marked Tegula, done between
                  several southern and northern sites, showed that the lower
                  limit of distribution of adult Tegula on the shore at a given
                  site is influenced by the snails' defensive behavior. Where
                  predators were abundant, both southern and northern Tegula
                  placed low on the shore rapidly climbed to higher levels than
                  in locations where predators were scarce. The probable cause
                  of this upward migration is an avoidance response to chemical
                  exudates from predators. Southern Tegula also have an
                  inherently different response than northern Tegula; southern
                  snails always climbed upwards sooner and reached higher levels
                  than northern snails. This resulted in predators killing more
                  of the northern snails in these experiments. The behavioral
                  difference between southern and northern Tegula may be the
                  result of long-term differences in the intensity of predation
                  by octopuses, which are much rarer in the intertidal north of
                  central California than south of there. Young-of-the-year
                  Tegula were found mainly in the mid-intertidal region. The
                  shift in the direction of shore-level size gradients of Tegula
                  populations between high and low predation sites may be caused
                  by movements of adult snails to levels above or below the less
                  mobile juveniles. The relative scarcity of Tegula and other
                  grazing molluscs in the low intertidal zone is probably due
                  both to upward migration and high mortality rates, with
                  predation being a major cause of both.},

                  algal nitrogen content and thallus toughness were also
                  investigated. T. funebralis showed consistent feeding
                  preferences in the laboratory and in the field in pairwise
                  tests of 13 species of marine brown algae (Phaeophyta) from
                  central California. Relative levels of phenolic compounds,
                  which are known to deter feeding by herbivorous snails,
                  differed greatly between preferred and nonpreferred species of
                  algae. The total phenolic content of the six most preferred
                  species of algae averaged 0.83\% of dry mass; the phenolic
                  content of the seven least preferred species averaged 4.53\%.
                  Differences in relative tanning ability were similarly large.
                  Tannic acid, a terrestrial plant tanin, when experimentally
                  added to one kelp species, deterred feeding by T. funebralis.
                  These results and analyses of studies of additional species of
                  brown algae also showed consistent differences in the phenolic
                  content between species in the order Laminariales (typically
                  low) and those in the order Fucales (uniformly high). Feeding
                  preferences of other gastropod, echinoid, and crustacean
                  algivores from the northeast Pacific Ocean are strikingly
                  similar to those of T. funebralis; this supports the
                  contention that high levels of phenolic compounds in brown
                  algae are a generally effective feeding deterrent against many
                  kinds of marine invertebrate herbivores. Organic nitrogen
                  content of the algae was positively correlated with the
                  feeding preferences of T. funebralis. However, this was most
                  likely an indirect effect of the significant negative
                  correlation between algal nitrogen and phenolic contents.
                  Thallus toughness of the algae did not seem important in
                  determining overall feeding preferences of Tegula, but may
                  have affected choices between algae that were low in
                  phenolics. I suggest that feeding preferences of Tegula
                  funebralis for brown algae are primarily due to avoidance of
                  algal defenses; positive aspects of food quality (such as
                  attractants or nutritional content) probably play a lesser
                  role in determining preference.},

                  manner by natural physical disturbances and by interactions
                  with other species in the community. This study presents an
                  experimental evaluation of the effects of such disturbances
                  and competitive interactions on populations of sessile
                  organisms in the rocky intertidal community, for which space
                  can be demonstrated to be the most important limiting
                  resource. This research was carried out at eight stations on
                  the Washington coastline which have been ranked according to
                  an exposure/desiccation gradient and subjected to comparable
                  manipulation and observation. Physical variables such as wave
                  exposure, battering by drift logs, and desiccation have
                  important effects on the distribution and abundance of many of
                  the sessile species in the community. In particular, wave
                  exposure and desiccation have a major influence on the
                  distribution patterns of all the algae and of the anemone
                  Anthopleura elegantissima. The probability of damage from
                  drift logs is very high in areas where logs have accumulated
                  along the intertidal. Log damage and wave exposure have
                  complementary effects in the provision of free space in a
                  mussel bed, as wave shock enlarges a patch created by log
                  damage by wrenching the mussels from the substratum at the
                  periphery of the bare patch. Competition for primary space
                  results in clear dominance hierarchies, in which barnacles are
                  dominant over algae. Among the barnacles, Balanus cariosus is
                  dominant over both B. glandula and Chthamalus dalli; B.
                  glandula is dominant over C. dalli. The mussel Mytilus
                  californianus requires secondary space (certain algae,
                  barnacles, or byssal threads) for larval settlement, but is
                  capable of growing over all other sessile species and

                  montereyi live in the low-intertidal or subtidally. As indices
                  of thermal limits of heart function, we used the temperature
                  at which heart rate initially decreased rapidly during heating
                  (the Arrhenius break temperature, or ABT) and the temperature
                  at which heart ceased to beat with either heating or cooling
                  (the flatline temperature, or FLT(hot) or FLT(cold),
                  respectively). These three indices provide an estimate of the
                  thermal range within which Tegula heart function is
                  maintained. For field-acclimatized specimens, the thermal
                  range of the high-intertidal T. funebralis was greater than
                  those of its two lower-occurring congeners (higher ABT, higher
                  FLT(hot), lower FLT(cold)). We also demonstrated the effects
                  of constant thermal acclimation on the heart rate response to
                  heat stress. Acclimation to 14 degrees C and 22 degrees C
                  resulted in increases in ABT and FLT(hot), with the largest
                  changes in T. brunnea and T. montereyi. Although T. funebralis
                  is more heat tolerant and eurythermal than its two
                  lower-occurring congeners, it can encounter field body
                  temperatures that exceed ABT, indicating that T. funebralis
                  faces a larger threat from heat stress, in situ. These

                  populations of the inter- tidal snail Chlorostoma (Tegula)
                  funebralis were studied to determine the effects of
                  latitudinal region and coastal topography. Upwelling, which
                  may affect larval recruitment, varies along a latitudinal
                  gradient, while coastal topography may mitigate the effects of
                  latitude. Sites were categorized by lat- itude: Northern
                  (Oregon, 15 sites), and Southern (California, 5 sites; Baja
                  California, 2 sites); and by coastal topography: protected
                  (bays and coves, 7 sites in north, 3 in south), or exposed to
                  the open ocean (7 sites in north, 5 sites in south). In
                  Oregon, population structures at protected and exposed sites
                  were significantly different (p = 0.001). At protected sites,
                  a large percentage of individuals were pre-reproductive
                  juveniles. At exposed sites, the population was weighted
                  towards large indi- viduals capable of high reproductive
                  output with few juveniles present in the population. This pat-
                  tern may reflect inter-annual variation in recruitment in
                  Oregon, with protected areas experiencing more constant
                  recruitment. In California and Baja California all populations
                  were predominately composed of juveniles, regardless of
                  coastal topography (p = 0.336). Differences in age-structure
                  of the population create significant differences in relative
                  reproductive potential. The potential repro- ductive output of
                  a population was calculated by quantifying the eggs produced
                  by snails covering the size range of reproductive individuals.
                  Populations in the north at exposed sites produce eggs at a
                  rate up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than populations in
                  the south (p = 0.004). These variations in size-structure of
                  C. funebralis populations with coastal topography and latitude
                  may have impor- tant impacts for the population distribution.},

                  is poorly understood, but can be assessed by combining data
                  from physiological and ecological studies. The species most at
                  risk are exclusively marine and have limited physiological
                  capacities to adjust to environmental change. They are poor
                  iono- and osmoregulators and have limited abilities to
                  compensate for acid-base dis- turbances. The problems are
                  compounded in slow-moving, relatively inactive species because
                  they have low circulating protein levels and low buffering
                  capacities. Species living in low-energy envi- ronments, such
                  as deep-sea and polar habitats, are particularly vulnerable,
                  because they are meta- bolically limited with respect to
                  environmental change. Elevated pCO2 levels in seawater, such
                  as those predicted for the year 2300, are known to have
                  diverse effects on calcification rate, little effect on egg
                  production and a negative effect on growth rate and moulting
                  frequency in marine crustacean species. At these levels,
                  embryonic development is negatively impacted, but larval and
                  juvenile stages do not appear to be affected, unless the
                  changes in pCO2 are accompanied by rising tempera- tures.
                  Overall, marine crustaceans are broadly tolerant to the
                  seawater pCO2 levels expected by 2100 and 2300, but only in
                  the medium-term (weeks) and only in the more adaptable
                  species. The reduc- tions in growth rate are of concern, as
                  these changes could affect species survival, distribution and
                  abundance. Studies are urgently needed to evaluate whether the
                  patterns of vulnerability identified here in crustaceans will
                  still be relevant after long-term (months) exposure to the
                  relevant pCO2 lev- els, in combination with changes in other
                  environmental factors.},

                  anthropogenic impacts, such as altered freshwater runoff
                  regimes or biomass harvesting. We are only beginning to grasp
                  the complexity of these interactive changes on ocean biota. To
                  understand the pronounced and/or nonlinear effects of
                  cumulative environmental stresses on organismal fitness and

  abstract     = {Climate change effects on marine ecosystems involve various
                  stressors, pre domi nantly temperature, hypoxia and CO2, all
                  of which may combine with further anthropogenic stressors such
                  as pollutants. All life forms respond to these drivers,
                  following potentially common principles, which are
                  insufficiently understood. Specific understanding may be most
                  advanced in animals where the concept of ‘oxygen and capacity
                  dependent thermal tolerance’ (OCLTT) is an integrator of
                  various effects, linking molecular to ecosystem levels of
                  biological organisation. Recent studies confirm OCLTT
                  involvement in the field, causing changes in species
                  abundance, biogeographical ranges, phenology and species
                  predominance. At the wholeanimal level, performance capacity
                  set by aerobic scope and energy budget, building on baseline
                  energy turnover, links fitness (within a thermal window) and
                  functioning at the ecosystem level. In variable environments
                  like the intertidal zone, animals also exploit their capacity
                  for passive tolerance. While presently the temperature signal
                  appears predominant in the field, effects may well involve
                  other stressors, acting synergistically by narrowing the
                  aerobic OCLTT window. Recent findings support the OCLTT
                  concept as a common physiological basis linking apparently
                  disjunct effects of ocean warming, acidification and hypoxia
                  in a so-called climate syndrome. In brief, warming-induced CO2
                  accumulation in body fluids links to the effects of ocean
                  acidification mediated by the weak acid distribution of CO2.
                  Temperature-induced hypoxemia links to the hypoxia sensitivity
                  of thermal tolerance. Future work will need to develop proxies
                  for the temperature-dependent effects of climate-related

                  of anthropogenic CO2 in marine surface waters, the present
                  study addresses the effects of long-term hypercapnia on a
                  Mediterranean bivalve, Mytilus galloprovincialis. Sea-water pH
                  was lowered to a value of 7.3 by equilibration with elevated
                  CO2 levels. This is close to the maximum pH drop expected in
                  marine sur- face waters during atmospheric CO2 accumulation.
                  Intra- and extracellular acid-base parameters as well as
                  changes in metabolic rate and growth were studied under both
                  normocapnia and hypercap- nia. Long-term hypercapnia caused a
                  permanent reduction in haemolymph pH. To limit the degree of
                  acidosis, mussels increased haemolymph bicarbonate levels,
                  which are derived mainly from the dissolution of shell CaCO3.
                  Intracellular pH in various tissues was at least partly
                  compensated; no deviation from control values occurred during
                  long-term measurements in whole soft-body tissues. The rate of
                  oxygen consumption fell significantly, indicating a lower
                  metabolic rate. In line with pre- vious reports, a close
                  correlation became evident between the reduction in
                  extracellular pH and the reduction in metabolic rate of
                  mussels during hypercapnia. Analysis of frequency histograms
                  of growth rate revealed that hypercapnia caused a slowing of
                  growth, possibly related to the reduction in metabolic rate
                  and the dissolution of shell CaCO3 as a result of
                  extracellular acidosis. In addition, increased nitrogen
                  excretion by hypercapnic mussels indicates the net degradation
                  of protein, thereby contributing to growth reduction. The
                  results obtained in the present study strongly indicate that a
                  reduction in sea-water pH to 7.3 may be fatal for the mussels.
                  They also confirm previous obser- vations that a reduction in
                  sea-water pH below 7.5 is harmful for shelled molluscs.},

  abstract     = {Just as organisms do not passively exist in their environment,
                  developing sea turtle embryos affect their own incubation
                  microclimate by producing metabolic heat and other waste
                  products. This metabolic heat ultimately contributes to
                  successful development, but it is unclear how it influences
                  embryonic traits such as hatchling sex, and whether trends
                  exist in the magnitude of metabolic heat produced by different
                  species. In this systematic review, we document all empirical
                  measurements of metabolic heat in sea turtle species, its
                  impact on their development, and explore the methods used to
                  predict nest temperature and how these methods account for
                  metabolic heat. Overall we found metabolic heat increases
                  throughout incubation in all seven species. Typically, the
                  temperature at the center of an egg clutch peaked during the
                  final third of incubation, and exceeded the adjacent sand
                  temperature by 2.5°C. Metabolic heat was not influenced by
                  species or clutch size (n = 16 studies), but this finding was
                  likely influenced by inconsistency in the methods used to
                  measure metabolic heat, and by localized differences in sand
                  properties, such as moisture, albedo, and thermal
                  conductivity. The influence of metabolic heat on embryo sex
                  determination and survival was dependent on the sand
                  temperature surrounding the nest chamber, and had an
                  appreciable affect only when it caused nest temperatures to
                  exceed key thresholds for sex determination and survival.
                  Methods for modeling nest temperature were either correlative
                  (70\% of publications) or mechanistic (30\% of publications).
                  Correlative models describe relationships between empirical
                  data to predict sand temperature, while mechanistic models are
                  based on physical laws and do not require extrapolation when
                  predicting novel situations, such as climate change. Most
                  correlative models (74\%) accounted for metabolic heat when
                  predicting nest temperatures, but no mechanistic models
                  did—largely because they were developed for predicting primary
                  sex ratios, which are widely believed to be unaffected by
                  metabolic heat. Consequently, developing a generalisable
                  mechanistic model that incorporates metabolic heat will be
                  critical for predicting incubation success as the sand
                  temperatures at sea turtle beaches increase due to
                  anthropogenic climate change.},

                  properties of the ocean that have consequences for marine
                  ecosystems. Here, we review evidence for the responses of
                  marine life to recent climate change across ocean regions,
                  from tropical seas to polar oceans. We consider observed
                  changes in calcification rates, demography, abundance,
                  distribution and phenology of marine species. We draw on a
                  database of observed climate change impacts on marine species,
                  supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of
                  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss
                  factors that limit or facilitate species’ responses, such as
                  fishing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and
                  other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents. We find that
                  general trends in species responses are consistent with
                  expectations from climate change, including poleward and
                  deeper distributional shifts, advances in spring phenology,
                  declines in calcification and increases in the abundance of
                  warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence of species
                  responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions
                  and taxonomic groups, with much evidence derived from the
                  heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of
                  marine biological impacts of climate change are of the impacts
                  of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of
                  changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters)
                  or ocean acidification. Observations of species responses that
                  have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are
                  widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups
                  (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals).},

                  addition, they show extreme vulnerability to anthropogenic
                  impacts. Research on multiple drivers is therefore crucial to
                  understand the complexity of their potential interactions.
                  Here, we first give an overview of the natural environment and
                  impacts of climate change on rocky shore intertidal systems,
                  and then focus on the impacts of multiple drivers. We further
                  provide a summary of existing multiple driver studies in the

                  occurs in patches of characteristic individual size structure.
                  Various energy flow parameters have been determined for a high
                  intertidal (+ 1.8 to +0.9 m) and a low intertidal (+0.6 to
                  −0.15 m) subpopulation; these values were then combined in a
                  3:1 ratio to generate a composite population.Direct and
                  indirect calorimetry and direct observation on the natural
                  population suggest the following: Tegula spawns once per year;
                  the dry weight‐shell diameter relationships for males and

                  individual, 211 mg dry wt, respires at a rate of 75 µl O2/hr
                  in water and 43 µl/hr in air).The energy budget, in which
                  ingestion was obtained by summation, suggests an assimilation
                  efficiency of about 70\%, a gross efficiency of growth of
                  16.7\%, and an ecological efficiency of predators of 4.9\%.
                  Other efficiencies are discussed. In Tegula, 60\% of energy
                  transferred to other levels is to decomposers. Comparison of
                  the rate of annual consumption by Tegula, 1,071 kcal m− 2
                  yr−1, and net primary production estimated by cropping, 1,167

                  (CCLME), a temperate marine region dominated by episodic
                  upwelling, is predicted to experience rapid environmental
                  change in the future due to ocean acidification. The aragonite
                  saturation state within the California Current System is
                  predicted to decrease in the future with near-permanent
                  undersaturation conditions expected by the year 2050. Thus,
                  the CCLME is a critical region to study due to the rapid rate
                  of environmental change that resident organisms will
                  experience and because of the economic and societal value of
                  this coastal region. Recent efforts by a research consortium –
                  the Ocean Margin Ecosystems Group for Acidification Studies
                  (OMEGAS) – has begun to characterize a portion of the CCLME;
                  both describing the spatial mosaic of pH in coastal waters and
                  examining the responses of key calcification-dependent benthic
                  marine organisms to natural variation in pH and to changes in
                  carbonate chemistry that are expected in the coming decades.
                  In this review, we present the OMEGAS strategy of co-locating
                  sensors and oceanographic observations with biological studies
                  on benthic marine invertebrates, specifically measurements of
                  functional traits such as calcification-related processes and
                  genetic variation in populations that are locally adapted to
                  conditions in a particular region of the coast. Highlighted in
                  this contribution are (1) the OMEGAS sensor network that spans

  abstract     = {Abstract. Ocean acidity extreme events are short-term periods
                  of relatively high [H+] concentrations. The uptake of
                  anthropogenic CO2 emissions by the ocean is expected to lead
                  to more frequent and intense ocean acidity extreme events, not
                  only due to changes in the long-term mean but also due to
                  changes in short-term variability. Here, we use daily mean
                  output from a five-member ensemble simulation of a
                  comprehensive Earth system model under low- and
                  high-CO2-emission scenarios to quantify historical and future
                  changes in ocean acidity extreme events. When defining
                  extremes relative to a fixed preindustrial baseline, the
                  projected increase in mean [H+] causes the entire surface
                  ocean to reach a near-permanent acidity extreme state by 2030
                  under both the low- and high-CO2-emission scenarios. When
                  defining extremes relative to a shifting baseline (i.e.,
                  neglecting the changes in mean [H+]), ocean acidity extremes
                  are also projected to increase because of the simulated
                  increase in [H+] variability; e.g., the number of days with
                  extremely high surface [H+] conditions is projected to
                  increase by a factor of 14 by the end of the 21st century
                  under the high-CO2-emission scenario relative to preindustrial
                  levels. Furthermore, the duration of individual extreme events
                  is projected to triple, and the maximal intensity and the
                  volume extent in the upper 200 m are projected to quintuple.
                  Similar changes are projected in the thermocline. Under the
                  low-emission scenario, the increases in ocean acidity
                  extreme-event characteristics are substantially reduced. At
                  the surface, the increases in [H+] variability are mainly
                  driven by increases in [H+] seasonality, whereas changes in
                  thermocline [H+] variability are more influenced by
                  interannual variability. Increases in [H+] variability arise
                  predominantly from increases in the sensitivity of [H+] to
                  variations in its drivers (i.e., carbon, alkalinity, and
                  temperature) due to the increase in oceanic anthropogenic
                  carbon. The projected increase in [H+] variability and
                  extremes may enhance the risk of detrimental impacts on marine
                  organisms, especially for those that are adapted to a more
                  stable environment.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide
                  (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere,
                  ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is
                  critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support
                  the development of climate policies, and project future
                  climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and
                  methodologies to quantify the five major components of the
                  global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2
                  emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement
                  production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC),
                  mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use
                  change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2
                  concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM)
                  is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The
                  ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean
                  biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products.
                  The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic
                  global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget
                  imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total
                  emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean,
                  and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and
                  understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All
                  uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the year 2021, EFOS
                  increased by 5.1 \% relative to 2020, with fossil emissions at
                  10.1 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement
                  carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.1 ± 0.7 GtC
                  yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the
                  cement carbonation sink) of 10.9 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1 (40.0 ± 2.9
                  GtCO2). Also, for 2021, GATM was 5.2 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.5 ± 0.1
                  ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.9 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5 ±
                  0.9 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of −0.6 GtC yr−1 (i.e. the total
                  estimated sources were too low or sinks were too high). The
                  global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2021
                  reached 414.71 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2022 suggest an
                  increase in EFOS relative to 2021 of +1.0 \% (0.1 \% to 1.9
                  \%) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 417.2
                  ppm, more than 50 \% above pre-industrial levels (around 278
                  ppm). Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the
                  global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the
                  period 1959–2021, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1
                  persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal
                  variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from
                  multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent
                  large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change
                  emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods
                  on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern
                  extratropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different
                  methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last
                  decade. This living data update documents changes in the
                  methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget
                  and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle
                  compared with previous publications of this data set. The data

  abstract     = {Abstract. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
                  (IPCC) physical science reports usually assess a handful of
                  future scenarios, the Working Group III contribution on
                  climate mitigation to the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6
                  WGIII) assesses hundreds to thousands of future emissions
                  scenarios. A key task in WGIII is to assess the global mean
                  temperature outcomes of these scenarios in a consistent
                  manner, given the challenge that the emissions scenarios from
                  different integrated assessment models (IAMs) come with
                  different sectoral and gas-to-gas coverage and cannot all be
                  assessed consistently by complex Earth system models. In this
                  work, we describe the “climate-assessment” workflow and its
                  methods, including infilling of missing emissions and
                  emissions harmonisation as applied to 1202 mitigation
                  scenarios in AR6 WGIII. We evaluate the global mean
                  temperature projections and effective radiative forcing (ERF)
                  characteristics of climate emulators FaIRv1.6.2 and
                  MAGICCv7.5.3 and use the CICERO simple climate model
                  (CICERO-SCM) for sensitivity analysis. We discuss the implied
                  overshoot severity of the mitigation pathways using overshoot
                  degree years and look at emissions and temperature
                  characteristics of scenarios compatible with one possible
                  interpretation of the Paris Agreement. We find that the lowest
                  class of emissions scenarios that limit global warming to “1.5
                  ∘C (with a probability of greater than 50 \%) with no or
                  limited overshoot” includes 97 scenarios for MAGICCv7.5.3 and
                  203 for FaIRv1.6.2. For the MAGICCv7.5.3 results, “limited
                  overshoot” typically implies exceedance of median temperature
                  projections of up to about 0.1 ∘C for up to a few decades
                  before returning to below 1.5 ∘C by or before the year 2100.
                  For more than half of the scenarios in this category that
                  comply with three criteria for being “Paris-compatible”,
                  including net-zero or net-negative greenhouse gas (GHG)
                  emissions, median temperatures decline by about 0.3–0.4 ∘C
                  after peaking at 1.5–1.6 ∘C in 2035–2055. We compare the
                  methods applied in AR6 with the methods used for SR1.5 and
                  discuss their implications. This article also introduces a
                  “climate-assessment” Python package which allows for fully
                  reproducing the IPCC AR6 WGIII temperature assessment. This
                  work provides a community tool for assessing the temperature
                  outcomes of emissions pathways and provides a basis for
                  further work such as extending the workflow to include
                  downscaling of climate characteristics to a regional level and
                  calculating impacts.},

  abstract     = {The importance of normal distribution is undeniable since it
                  is an underlying assumption of many statistical procedures
                  such as I-tests, linear regression analysis, discriminant
                  analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). When the normality
                  assumption is violated, interpretation and inferences may not
                  be reliable or valid. The three common procedures in assessing
                  whether a random sample of independent observations of size n
                  come from a population with a normal distribution are:
                  graphical methods (histograms, boxplots, Q-Q-plots), numerical
                  methods (skewness and kurtosis indices) and formal normality
                  tests. This paper* compares the power of four formal tests of
                  normality: Shapiro-Wilk (SW) test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
                  test, Lillie/ors (LF) test and Anderson-Darling (AD) test.
                  Power comparisons of these four tests were obtained via Monte
                  Carlo simulation of sample data generated from alternative
                  distributions that follow symmetric and asymmetric
                  distributions. Ten thousand samples of various sample size
                  were generated from each of the given alternative symmetric
                  and asymmetric distributions. The power of each test was then
                  obtained by comparing the test of normality statistics with
                  the respective critical values. Results show that Shapiro-Wilk
                  test is the most powerful normality test, followed by
                  Anderson-Darling test, Lillie/ors test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov
                  test. However, the power of all four tests is still low for
                  small sample size.},

               of theoretical and empirical work generates new insights about
               the process of thermal adaptation and points the way towards a
               more general theory. The threat of rapid climate change on a
               global scale provides a stark reminder of the challenges that
               remain for thermal biologists and adds a sense of urgency to this
               book's mission." "Thermal Adaptation will benefit anyone seeking
               to understand the relationship between environmental variation

               evolutionary models at the individual, population, and community

               empirical approaches. By providing a synthetic overview of

               the Ancient Greek scholar Aristotle made observations and wrote
               about Mediterranean sea urchins. The considerable knowledge of
               what to eat and where it could be found has been passed down
               since prehistoric times by oral tradition in many societies - in
               Britain it is still unwise to eat shellfish in months without an
               'r' in them. Over the last three hundred years or so we have seen
               the formalization of science and this of course has touched
               intertidal ecology. Linnaeus classified specimens collected from
               the seashore and many common species (Patella vulgata L. ,
               Mytilus edulis L. , Littorina littorea (L. )) bear his imprint
               because he formally described, named and catalogued them. Early
               natural historians described zonation patterns in the first part
               of the 19th century (Audouin and Milne-Edwards, 1832), and the
               Victorians became avid admirers and collectors of shore animals
               and plants with the advent of the new fashion of seaside holidays
               (Gosse, 1856; Kingsley, 1856). As science became professionalized
               towards the end of the century, marine biologists took advantage
               of low tides to gain easy access to marine life for taxonomic
               work and classical studies of functional morphology. The first
               serious studies of the ecology of the shore were made at this

               physiological function under a vast array of environmental
               conditions. This book describes how the abilities of organisms to
               thrive in widely different environments derive from two
               fundamental classes of biochemical adaptions: modifications of
               core biochemical processes that allow a common set of
               physiological functions to be conserved, and "inventions" of new
               biochemical traits that allow entry into novel habitats.
               Biochemical Adaptation: Mechanisms and Process in Physiological
               Evolution asks two primary questions. First, how have the core
               biochemical systems found in all species been adaptively modified
               to allow the same fundamental types of physiological processes to
               be sustained throughout the wide range of habitat conditions
               found in the biosphere? Second, through what types of genetic and
               biochemical processes have new physiological functions been

  abstract  = {An R Companion to Applied Regression is a broad introduction to
               the R statistical computing environment in the context of applied
               regression analysis. John Fox and Sanford Weisberg provide a
               step-by-step guide to using the free statistical software R, an
               emphasis on integrating statistical computing in R with the
               practice of data analysis, coverage of generalized linear models,
               and substantial web-based support materials. The Third Edition
               includes a new chapter on mixed-effects models, new and updated
               data sets, and a de-emphasis on statistical programming, while
               retaining a general introduction to basic R programming. The
               authors have substantially updated both the car and effects

  abstract     = {Question: Associations of body size and of body temperature
                  with fitness have complex relationships for ectotherms, but
                  three general patterns are known. Bigger is better: Larger
                  body size is frequently associated with greater fitness within
                  populations. Hotter is smaller: Smaller adult body sizes
                  typically result from development at higher temperatures.
                  Hotter is better: Greater maximal performance at the optimal
                  temperature is frequently associated with higher optimal
                  temperatures. How do we – or even can we – reconcile these
                  three apparently conflicting empirical patterns about
                  temperature, size, and fitness of ectotherms? Methods: We
                  summarize available evidence supporting or contradicting these
                  three rules. We present a conceptual framework that describes
                  how developmental and adult body temperatures affect causal
                  connections among size, performance, and key components of
                  fitness. Findings: There is strong empirical support for
                  Bigger is better and Hotter is smaller (≥ 79\% of
                  studies/estimates), primarily for terrestrial insects,
                  reptiles, and annual plants. Evidence regarding Hotter is
                  better is still limited (and primarily from terrestrial
                  insects), but most available information supports the rule.
                  Analyses of counterexamples are particularly instructive. The
                  rules operate at different levels. Bigger is better describes
                  phenotypic variation within populations. Hotter is smaller
                  describes phenotypic plasticity of a genotype. Hotter is
                  better describes evolved variation in reaction norms among
                  genotypes or between species. Conclusions: We unify these
                  three rules into a path diagram that describes how temperature
                  impacts critical rate processes throughout the life cycle.
                  Adult body size and development time are key traits that are
                  not only consequences of temperature-dependent processes, but
                  also are causes of variation in fitness. An unresolved issue
                  involves how to determine the appropriate fitness metric for a
                  particular ecological context (population and environment).
                  For example, the intrinsic rate of population increase (r) is
                  strongly influenced by generation time (and development time),
                  whereas net reproductive rate (R0) is strongly influenced by
                  fecundity (and size). Because the relative strengths of
                  different paths contributing to fitness change differ for
                  these fitness metrics, the choice of metric can affect whether
                  Hotter is better is ‘better’ than Bigger is better.},

               generations, has now been completely revised and expanded.
               Between Pacific Tides is a book for all who find the shore a
               place of excitement, wonder, and beauty, and an unsurpassed
               introductory text for both students and professionals. This book
               describes the habits and habitats of the animals that live in one
               of the most prolific life zones of the world--the rocky shores
               and tide pools of the Pacific Coast of the United States. The
               intricate and fascinating life processes of these creatures are
               described with affectionate care. The animals are grouped
               according to their most characteristic habitat, whether rocky
               shore, sandy beach, mud flat, or wharf piling, and the authors
               discuss their life history, physiology, and community relations,
               and the influence of wave shock and shifting tide level. Though
               the basic purpose and structure--and much of the text--of the
               book remain the same, content has been increased by about 20
               percent; a multitude of changes and additios has been made in the
               text; the Annotated Systematic Index and General Bibliography
               have been updated and greatly expanded (now almost 2,300
               entries); more than 200 new photographs and drawings have been
               incorporated; and an entirely new chapter has been added--a
               topical presentation of the several factors influencing
               distribution of organisms along the shore. This edition also
               includes John Steinbeck's Foreword to the 1948 edition.},
